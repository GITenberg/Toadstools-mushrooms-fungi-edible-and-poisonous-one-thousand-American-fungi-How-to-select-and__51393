  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>A score of years ago (1880–1885) I was living in the mountains of
West Virginia. While riding on horseback through the dense forests of
that great unfenced state, I saw on every side luxuriant growths of fungi,
so inviting in color, cleanliness and flesh that it occurred to me they
ought to be eaten. I remembered having read a short time before this
inspiration seized me a very interesting article in the Popular Science
Monthly for May, 1877, written by Mr. Julius A. Palmer, Jr., entitled
“Toadstool Eating.” Hunting it up I studied it carefully, and soon
found myself interested in a delightful study which was not without immediate
reward. Up to this time I had been living, literally, on the
fat of the land—bacon; but my studies enabled me to supplement this,
the staple dish of the state, with a vegetable luxury that centuries ago
graced the dinners of the Cæsars. So absorbing did the study become
from gastronomic, culinary and scientific points of view, that I have continued
it ever since, with thorough intellectual enjoyment and much
gratification of appetite as my reward. I hope to interest students in
the study as I am myself interested.</p>

<p class='c000'>For twenty years my little friends—the toadstools—have been my
constant companions. They have interested me, delighted me, fed me,
and I have found much pleasure in making the public acquainted with
their habits, structure, lusciousness and food value.</p>

<p class='c000'>My researches have been confined to the species large enough to appease
the appetite of a hungry naturalist if found in reasonable quantity;
and my work has been devoted to segregating the edible and innocuous
from the tough, undesirable and poisonous kinds. To accomplish this,
because of the persistent inaccuracy of the books upon the subject, it
was necessary to personally test the edible qualities of hundreds of
species about which mycologists have either written nothing or have
followed one another in giving erroneous information. While often
wishing I had not undertaken the work because of the unpleasant results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>from personally testing fungi which proved to be poisonous, my reward
has been generous in the discovery of many delicacies among the more
than seven hundred edible varieties I have found.</p>

<p class='c000'>For ten years I have planned to publish in book form what I know
about toadstools; each effort to compile my information has shown me
how much more I ought to know before going into print. Even now
my work is still unfinished.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am urged by my many toadstool friends (as I lovingly call those
who, from all over the land, send me specimens for identification, and
grow interested with me in the work), to publish what I already know
upon the subject, that they, and others, may have a helpful book to
guide them to a goodly portion of the edible species, and away from
those that are inedible or poisonous.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this book I comply with these requests. I have selected over seven
hundred of the most plentiful and best varieties for the table, from my
toadstool bill of fare; and I describe and caution against several species,
some of which are deadly in their effects, if eaten; others of which induce
ill-effects more or less serious. One thousand species and varieties
are named and described.</p>

<p class='c000'>Birds, flowers, insects, stones delight the observant. Why not toadstools?
A tramp after them is absorbing, study of them interesting,
and eating of them health-giving and supremely satisfying.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>America is without a text-book of the American species of Fungi,
among which the edible and poisonous varieties are found. Many
excellent but expensive foreign volumes describe species common to
both continents, and several special but widely scattered monographs
have been published here. The need of the mycologist, mycophagist
and amateur toadstool student is a book giving the genus, names and
descriptions of the prominent American toadstools whose edibility has
been tested, or whose poisonous qualities have been discovered. The
absence of such a book, and the universal and rapidly-growing interest
all over the United States in edible fungi, have led to the publication of
the present work, which includes every species known to be esculent in
North America. As a precautionary measure, full explications of all
those known or suspected to be poisonous are included.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many species found in this country only have been described and
named by various authors, from the time of Schweinitz (1822) to the
present day. These have been published in the botanical magazines
and in the papers of scientific societies and colleges. The greater number
have as author Professor Charles H. Peck, New York State Botanist,
who has contributed an annual report each year from 1868. These
appear in the reports of the State Museum of New York, and coming
from the pen of our ablest mycologist are of great value to everyone
interested in the study. The classifications and (in many instances)
modified descriptions by such an eminent authority upon fungoid growth
should therefore be the guides to American forms, that the confusion
created by numerous descriptions of the same fungus by different observers
may be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor N.L. Britton, editor of the Torrey Botanical Club, has
courteously given permission to use the descriptions of new species
given in its instructive Bulletins.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor A.P. Morgan and Laura V. Morgan, with equal courtesy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>grant the use of text and illustrations contained in the most complete
monograph published upon the Lycoperdaceæ (puff-balls, etc.) of
America.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the scientific classifications and descriptions have been strictly
followed, the language has been simplified—with no sacrifice of scientific
accuracy—that this volume may be fully adapted to popular use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck has given his valuable assistance in the identification
of many species, all that were difficult or obscure having been submitted
to him, and the writer is deeply indebted to him for many and long-continued
courtesies, aiding in study and in the preparation of this work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several new species have been found by the writer, the greater part
of excellent food value. He preferred that these should be named, described
and placed in their proper genus and section by Professor Peck,
believing it to be best for the discoverers of new species to defer to one
whose vast experience enables him to name and classify in accordance
with the demands of American species.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where a species is vouched for as edible, it has been personally tested
by the author and his willing undertasters up to eating full meals of it,
or at least beyond all doubt as to its safety. Where others have eaten
species which he has not had the opportunity to test, their names and
opinions are given. When species heretofore under the ban of suspicion
are in this volume, for the first time, announced to be edible (there are
many of them), personal tests have not been considered sufficient, as
idiosyncrasy might have affected the results. Others, at the writer’s request,
have eaten of the species until their innocence was fully established.
In some cases, where the reputation of the fungi eaten was especially bad,
scientists of note have made elaborate and exhaustive physiological tests
of their substances, and in every instance confirmed the human testing.</p>

<p class='c000'>While species which contain deadly poisons are few, their individuals
are produced in great number. Nicety in distinguishing their botanic
variance from edible species closely resembling them is necessary. No
charm will detect the poison. Eating toadstools before their certain
identification as belonging to edible species, is neither bravery nor
common sense. The amateur should go slow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question often asked is: By what rule do you distinguish between
edible and poisonous mushrooms? The answer usually surprises the
questioner—there is no general rule. All such rules which have been
given are false and unreliable. The quality of each was learned, one at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>a time. Sweet and sour apples alike grow on large and small trees, may
be red or green, large or small, oblong or globular, and no visible appearance
gives the least clue to the quality.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few genera certain rules may be applied, as in Clavaria--all not
bitter or tough are edible. But such generalizations are each limited to
its own genus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The toadstools containing deadly poisons are thought to be confined
to one genus of the gilled kind—Amanita, and to Helvella esculenta,
now Gyromitra esculenta, to which are charged fatal results. The
poisonous qualities of Gyromitra esculenta are not proven. Recent
testings of this species prove it to be harmless and of good quality. By
far the greater number of species contained in Amanita are notable for
their tender substance and delicious flavor. By their stately beauty and
unusual attractiveness both the poisonous and harmless kinds are seductive.
<em>Any toadstool with white or lemon-yellow gills, casting white
spores when laid—gills downward—upon a sheet of paper, having remnants
of a fugitive skin in the shape of scabs or warts upon the upper
surface of its cap, with a veil or ring, or remnants or stains of one, having
at the base of its stem—in the ground—a loose, skin-like sheath surrounding
it, or remnants of one, should never be eaten until the collector
is thoroughly conversant with the technicalities of every such species, or
has been taught by one whose authority is well known, that it is a harmless
species.</em> This rule purposely includes the renowned Amanita Cæsaria,
everywhere written as luscious. I regard it as the most dangerous
of toadstools, because of its close resemblance to its sister plant—the
Amanita muscaria—which is deadly. In the description of these species,
other forcible reasons are given.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another deadly species—the Amanita phalloides—is frequently mistaken
by the inexperienced for the common mushroom. Safety lies in
the strict observance of two rules: Never eat a toadstool found in the
woods or shady places, believing it to be the common mushroom.
Never eat a white- or yellow-gilled toadstool in the same belief. The
common mushroom does not grow in the woods, and its gills are at first
pink, then purplish-brown or black.</p>

<p class='c000'>If through carelessness, or by accident, a poisonous Amanita has
been eaten, and sickness results, take an emetic at once, and send for a
physician with instructions to bring hypodermic syringe and atropine
sulphate. The dose is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>180</sub> of a grain, and doses should be continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>heroically until the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>20</sub> of a grain is administered, or until, in the physician’s
opinion, a proper quantity has been injected. Where the victim
is critically ill the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>20</sub> of a grain may be administered.</p>

<p class='c000'>In every case of toadstool poisoning, the physician must be guided
by the symptoms exhibited. Professor W.S. Carter, by numerous
exhaustive trials upon animals, has proved that atropine, while valuable
as against the <em>first</em>, is not an antidote for the <em>late</em> effects of the greater
toadstool poisons. (See his chapter on toadstool poisons, especially
prepared for this work.)</p>

<p class='c000'>There are other species which contain minor poisons producing very
undesirable effects. These are soon remedied by taking an emetic,
then one or two doses of whisky and sweet oil; or vinegar may be
substituted for the whisky. A few species of fungi are innocuous to
the majority of persons and harmful to a few. So it is with many
common foods—strawberries, apples, tomatoes, celery, even potatoes.
The beginner at toadstool eating usually expects commendation for
bravery, and fearfully watches for hours the coming of something
dreadful. Indigestion from any other cause is always laid to the traditionary
enemy, fright ensues, a physician is called, the scare spreads,
and a pestilential story of “Severe Poisoning by Toadstools,” gets into
the newspapers. The writer has traced many such publications to imprudences
in eating, with which toadstools had nothing to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>The authoritative analysis of several common food species by Lafayette
B. Mendel, of Sheffield Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry,
Yale University, is given, and will correct the popular error about the
great nutritive value of fungi, arising from previous erroneous analyses.</p>

<p class='c000'>While species are reported as found in certain localities, it by no
means follows that their growth is confined to these places. A species
reported as found in the Adirondack mountains, unless belonging to the
few peculiar to northern regions and high altitudes, is reasonably sure
to be more plentiful in a like habitat south and west of them. South
it will appear earlier and its season last longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Size is largely dependent upon latitude and may vary greatly in the
same group. Temperature, moisture, favorable nourishment are important
factors in growth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each species has its favorite habitat, and will thrive best upon it.
There are few things under the sun upon which fungi do not grow.
Their mission is particularly directed toward converting decaying matter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>or matter which has accomplished its work in one direction, into
usefulness in another. They are the wood-choppers, stewards, caterers
of the forest, converters in the fields and chemists everywhere. They
can not assimilate inorganic matter because of the absence of chlorophyl
in their composition, but in organic matter they are omnivorous. When
they feed on dead substances they are called saprophytes; when their
support is derived from living tissues, parasites.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scores of species of fungi were found in the forests, ravines and clearings
of the West Virginia mountains from 1881 to 1885 inclusive, and
eaten by the writer years before he had the opportunity to learn their
names from books or obtain the friendly assistance of experts in identifying
them. He knew the individuals without knowing their names, as
one knows the bird song and plumage before formal introduction to the
pretty creatures that charm him.</p>

<p class='c000'>After he was able to get European publications upon the subject, and
by their aid trace the species he had eaten to their names, descriptions
and qualities, he was surprised to read that many of them were warned
against as deadly. As informed by these books, he properly ought to
have died several times. It soon became evident that authors had followed
one another in condemning species, some because they bore brilliant
hues, others because they were unpleasant when raw (just as is a
potato), rather than investigate their qualities by testing them. Here
was a realm of food-giving plants almost entirely unexplored. The
writer determined to explore it. Instead of the one hundred and eleven
species then recorded by the late Doctor Curtis as edible, my number
of edible species now exceeds his by over six hundred.<a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c019'><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='fA'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#rA'>A</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This book contains one hundred and fifty pages more than were originally estimated
and promised to the subscribers. That all known edible and poisonous species
might be fully described and published within one volume, the author was compelled
to cut fifty thousand words from his manuscript. The localities from which species
have been reported and the names of the reporters have been taken out, excepting
where it was desirable to show that foreign species have been found in the United
States, and where tested species have been found by the author. The principal cut
has been from the notes of the author and of enlarged descriptions.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Let us clear away the rubbish and superstition that have so long obscured
the straight path to a knowledge of edible toadstools. Let us
bear in mind that a mushroom is a toadstool and a toadstool is a mushroom—the
terms are interchangeable. If toads ever occupied the one-legged
seat assigned them from time immemorial, they have learned in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>this enlightened age that the ground is much more reliable, and so squat
upon it, except when exercising their constitutional right to hop. Snails,
slugs, insects of many kinds, mice, squirrels and rabbits prey upon good
and bad, each to its liking, notwithstanding oft-repeated assertion that
snails and slugs infect noxious varieties only, or that animals select the
innocuous only. We are warned against those which grow in the dark
or damp; the mushroom of commerce is grown by the ton in the subterranean
quarries of France, and everywhere in vaults and cellars for
domestic use. The valued truffle never sees the light until it is taken
from darkness to be eaten, and other varieties of the best prefer seclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wiseacres tell us that they must have equal gills, must not have
thin tops, must not turn yellow when sprinkled with salt, must not
blacken a silver spoon, that we must not eat of those changing color
when cut or broken, of those exuding milk, or those which are acrid,
hot, or bitter, and give many other specifics for determining the good
from the bad. These tests are all worse than worthless, for if confidence
is placed in them they will not only lead us away from esculent and
excellent varieties but directly into eating venomous ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are whole genera of fungi which are innocuous; but in the
Family of Agaricaceæ, where the greatest variety of the edible and poisonous
species are found, it is necessary to master one by one the details
of their construction and learn to distinguish their differences as one
does those of the many kinds of roses, or pinks, or hundreds of bright-faced
pansies, and in the mastery of them lies the only charm that will
safely guide.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carefully remove the first toadstool found from whatever it is growing
upon, and with it a portion of that from which it springs. If it is the
earth a curious white network is discernible, fine as the delicate spinning
of the spider, spreading its meshes throughout the mass. It will
often remind of miniature vines climbing over miniature lattices. This
is the mycelium from which the toadstool grew. In many instances it
penetrates the earth to a considerable depth, and takes possession of
large territory. It is often seen as the gardener turns up the soil or its
fertilizer, and is perhaps taken for a mold. If the specimen is gathered
from mat of wood leaves, the same white vine is observable slipping in
between its layers. If taken from a tree, the decaying wood is traversed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>by it. From wherever a toadstool is plucked, it is removed from its
mycelium.</p>

<p class='c000'>This mycelium is but a thread-like mass of simple cells joined
together at their ends and interlacing in a way a thousand-fold more
intricate than a Chinese puzzle. Nothing in its structure indicates what
its special product will be. The fungus which is plucked from it is in
all its parts simply a mass of these threads—cells strung together, interlacing
and ramifying.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the season favors, the mycelium—which has, winter and summer
and from year to year, lived its hidden life, or has sprung from a
germinating spore—develops a number of its cells in a minute knob,
small as a pin head. At this point the cells make special growth
efforts to bring themselves within the favoring influences of heat and
moisture; this tiny knob labors within itself, producing cell after cell,
which takes shape and function for the future toadstool.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it rapidly enlarges it pushes its way toward the surface of the
ground, becomes more or less egg-shaped in this stage of its growth,
and if cut in half longitudinally and examined, it will display what it is
going to be when it grows up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose that it belongs to the first of the two great sections into
which fungi are divided under the classification of Fries, who modified
that of Persoon. The first has the spores—which represent the seeds
in plants—naked, and it is called sporifera or spore-bearing. The second,
which has the spores enclosed in cells or cysts, is called sporidifera
or sporidia-bearing. If the cap of a gill-bearing toadstool be laid, gills
downward, on a watch crystal or piece of white paper for a few hours,
or, in some instances, a few minutes, a complete representation of the
spaces between the gills will be found deposited as an impalpable powder.
These are the spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first section is divided into four cohorts. Two of these have
hymeniums or spore-bearing surfaces more or less expanded. These
are Hymenomycetes and Gastromycetes. In Hymenomycetes the
hymenium is always exposed in matured plants, as with the common
mushroom. When young, some plants are covered with a membrane.
In Gastromycetes the hymenium is always concealed within a covering
which bursts at maturity, as with the Lycoperdons or puff-balls. Cohort
Coniomycetes includes rusts, smuts, etc., formed for the most part on
living plants. There is no hymenium present. The spores are produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>on the ends of inconspicuous threads, free or enclosed in a bottle-like
receptacle called a perithecium. Cohort Hypomycetes is composed
of those species of fungi commonly called molds. The spores are
produced, naked, from the ends of inconspicuous threads.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Agaricaceæ—the first family in Hymenomycetes—the young
plant is completely enveloped. (Plate <a href='#plate003'>III</a>, fig. B, p. 2.) Its head is
as yet undefined and its body may be classed as dumpy, but shut in
and protected are a great quantity of knife-like plaits (Plate <a href='#plate003'>III</a>, fig. C.,
p. 2), on the outer surface of which, when the plant matures, will be
borne its spores. It therefore belongs to the Hymenomycetes, and to
the Family Agaricaceæ—gill-bearing.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the ground becomes moist or there comes a heavy dew or a rain,
the young plant, closely compacted and very solid, which has been
under the surface for many days waiting its chance to get forth to light
and air, rapidly swells, breaks through the moistened earth, goes
rapidly to cell-making, ruptures its outside covering, the head expands
and in so doing spreads out its gills or hymenium. (Plate <a href='#plate003'>III</a>, figs. C,
D, E, p. 2.) The membrane which covered the gills either vanishes,
or gathers round the stem in the form of a ring or circular apron, or it
may partially adhere to the edges of the top, cap or pileus and hang as
a fringe from it; the stem elongates; the whole plant assumes the colors
of its species and in a few hours or days at most it stands forth, a
marvel of beauty, structure and workmanship.</p>

<p class='c000'>But little is known of how these spores reproduce themselves. The
microscope fails to completely penetrate the mystery. A whole fungus
is but a mass of cells, the spore is but one of them. That these simple
cells do produce after their kind there is no doubt, but so minute is the
germ and hidden its methods that science has failed to solve them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Family of Hymenomycetes is Agaricaceæ. Its members
always have gills or modifications of them. In some cases—notably in
Cantharellus—the gills have the appearance of smooth, raised veins
over which is the spore-bearing surface. The hymenium is but an
extension of the fibers of the cap, folded up like the plaits and flutings
of ruffles, and laundered with exquisite neatness. If it is carefully
detached and spread out like a fan it will cover a large surface, many
times the size of the cap from which it has been taken, and will show
that what is a consumption of material in dress ornamentation is
utilized by economical Dame Nature to increase the spore-bearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>surface within a small space and for purely business purposes—spore-bearing.
The color of these spores has much to do with the classification.
The microscope with high light reveals the delicate shades of
their coloring, but the main colors are readily distinguished by the
naked eye when the spores are collected in a mass on glass or paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Polyporaceæ have in place of gills closely packed tubes on the
inside of which is the spore-bearing surface; each has a mouth from
which to eject the spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hydnaceæ bear their spores from spines or spicules of various
length protruding from the external surface of the cap. Sometimes the
spines mock in miniature the stalactites of the Caverns of Luray, sometimes the
shaggy mane of the lion, sometimes flowing locks of hair.
These three Families belong to the Cohort Hymenomycetes, having
their spore-bearing surface exposed early in life by the rupture of the
universal veil.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lycoperdons or Puff-balls have the hymenium enclosed within an
outer case, just as the apple with its seeds is enclosed for a dumpling.
When the spores are matured the sack is ruptured and they escape as
the dusty powder so well known to all. The Puff-ball belongs to the
Cohort Gastromycetes, because its spores are protected within the hymenium
until they are matured.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are other Families which contain edible species. The Clavariaceæ—branched
or club-shaped—often found in as beautiful forms as
delight us in coral, includes a few.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Ascomycetes, of the covered spore division Sporidifera, there are
several species which are excellent, and as they dry readily are much
valued for flavoring purposes when winter forbids the growth of outdoor
fungi. Of these the Morell has preference. The cap is covered with
sinuosities and pits which bear the spores. There are several varieties
of the Morell in the United States. They are known among the country
people who cook and pickle them, as Honey-comb mushrooms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuberaceæ are subterranean fungi. The common truffle so
much prized by epicures is a good representative. It is found a foot or
more under the surface of the earth, and of such value is it that in some
countries pigs are trained to hunt it from its hiding place. It is one of
the few foreign growths apparently not taking kindly to our country.
Efforts have been made to import and cultivate it, but without success.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>It is possible, even probable, that it may yet be found in America by
assiduous search.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have said that there is but one way to distinguish the edible from
the non-edible fungi; that is by mastering the characteristics of each
species one by one. There are signs which point to the evil and those
which point to the good, but they must be used as signals, not directors.</p>

<p class='c000'>A nauseous, fetid odor should condemn a species as non-edible at
once. Those having the flavor of flour or fresh meal are generally
accepted as worthy of trial. Slimy, water-soaked, partially decomposed
plants, or those impressing one as unpleasant in any way, should
never find their place upon the table. Do not eat of any toadstool,
unknown to the collector, beyond the careful and systematic testing
required to determine whether it is edible or not.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few species have a serious charge remaining against them; that of
partiality. They unmistakably signify with whom they will agree and
with whom they will not. These are notably Clitocybe illudens, Lepiota
Morgani, Panæolus papilionaceus, all specialized in their places in the
text.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other species have hereditary taints upon their reputations. Most,
if not all of them have stood present tests and relieved themselves of
suspicion. But, alas that it should be so! The stigma must rest upon
them for yet a while and until their defenders are so numerous that their
purity, without a smirch, is popularly proclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wherever wood grows and decays as it will, Polyporus, Panus, Lenzites,
Schizophyllum and kindred genera stand prominently forth in
countless numbers. The great majority of them are inedible because of
their woody substance. A few are valued as food. Very many of them
yield their soluble matter and flavor when boiled, and in this way make
excellent soups and gravies, just as flax-seed and the bark of the slippery
elm yield succulent matter. These, however, are not, with a few
exceptions, mentioned in this book. Numbers of Clavarieæ and Hydneæ
are in the same category. M.C. Cooke tersely says: “Fruits
that are not peaches or apricots may be very good plums.” In the introductions
to genera their attributes are given; under “Instructions to
Students” every guide to identification and selection will be found.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Glossary, containing the botanic terms used in this book and, it is
believed, all other terms used by mycologists in describing fungi, follows
the descriptive text. It is strongly advised that it be carefully studied.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>The roots and derivatives of the botanic terms are fully and carefully
given by Dr. John W. Harshberger, professor of botany, University of
Pennsylvania, to whom the author is specially indebted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The excellent Glossary published by Dr. Edwin A. Daniels, Boston,
has furnished many comprehensive definitions. It is the property of
the Boston Mycological Club, and can be obtained from its secretary
for twenty-five cents.</p>

<p class='c000'>The determination of the proper accentuation of the generic and specific
terms has been in many cases a difficult task, and, in some cases,
owing to the dubious origin of the words in question, there is certainly
room for difference of opinion. This task has been kindly and conscientiously
performed by Prof. M.W. Easton, professor of Comparative
and English Philology, University of Pennsylvania. Thanks are
due to the Hon. Addison Brown, president of the Torrey Botanical
Club, and Dr. Nathaniel L. Britton, professor of Botany in Columbia
College, authors of “Illustrated Flora,” for the determination of the
accentuation of non-classical words ending in <em>inus</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three indexes are given: the first refers to the general contents, the
second to the genera, the third to species and their genera, alphabetically
arranged.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Emma P. Ewing and Mrs. Sarah T. Rorer have kindly furnished
some of their recipes for the preparation of several varieties of toadstools.
The best results of the author’s long experience in cooking
toadstools are given in the chapter “Recipes for Cooking and Preparing
for the Table,” together with others selected from many sources.
The personal taste of the server must be guide to the choice.</p>

<p class='c000'>A child-friend of the writer, in telling him of her mother’s cook, said:
“She’s a good cooker, but she has a bad temper.” A good “cooker”
will soon learn how to best display the individual flavor of each species.
And be it known that each species of toadstool has a flavor of its own.
These flavors vary as much as among meats and vegetables. No one
species can be taken as standard of excellence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest care has been taken to secure illustrations correct in
every botanic detail. With few exceptions the colored figures were
drawn and painted by the writer. To obtain this important feature the
requirements of art have frequently been sacrificed. An artist can make
a picture of a toadstool; the mycologist must guide his brush or pencil
in the making of a correct presentation. The happy combination of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>artist and mycologist occurs in Mr. Val. W. Starnes, Augusta, Ga., to
whom this volume owes many of its illustrations. Mr. Frank D. Briscoe,
widely known as an artist of rare ability, has arranged and painted
in groups the studies made by the writer from typical plants, and added
to the illustrations many excellent drawings of his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>The unfailing reliability of the sun has been masterfully used by Dr.
J.R. Weist, ex-Secretary of the American Society of Surgeons, Richmond,
Ind.; H.I. Miller, Superintendent Terre Haute and Indianapolis
Railroad, Terre Haute, Ind., and Mr. Luther G. Harpel, Lebanon, Pa.,
in making the unexcelled photographs generously contributed by them.
The author is most thankful to them and to Mr. C.G. Lloyd, Cincinnati,
Ohio—a scientific gentleman devoting lavishly of his time and
money to the spread of mycological knowledge—for the privilege of
selecting from his extensive collection of realistic photographs those
adaptable to the species described herein.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author’s thanks are gratefully given to the many who have by
help and encouragement furthered his efforts in producing this, the
first American text-book upon fungi. Space precludes the naming of
the many, but the few named do not outrank them in their interest, help
and the author’s appreciation:</p>

<p class='c000'>Miss Lydia M. Patchen, President of the Westfield, N.Y., Toadstool
Club (the first in America); Mrs. E.C. Anthony, Thomas J. Collins,
E.B. Sterling, Berry Benson, Melvil Dewey, New York State Librarian;
Dr. J.E. Schadle, Prof. J.P. Arnold, University of Pennsylvania;
Prof. W.S. Carter, University of Texas; Boston School of Natural
History; Massachusetts Horticultural Society; Prof. Wm. G. Farlow,
University of Harvard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus aided the author believes that his own conscientious, patient,
loved labor in the study of edible and non-edible fungi and the production
of this volume will be far-reaching in its one object—encouraging
the study of toadstools.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time for writing a complete flora of the United States has not
yet come; a large part of the country remains as yet unexplored by
mycologists; new species are being constantly discovered in the districts
best known. Every book on the subject must be necessarily incomplete.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, so far as concerns the known fungus-flora, there
is imperative need of some guide to the student, which shall at least
save him some part of the weary toil of hunting through the scattered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>literature in which alone, as things are at present, can be found the information
he seeks. In this book I have tried to meet this need. It is
not complete, but I have tried to so arrange the matter that the student
can always decide whether the particular specimen in hand is or is not
included, and, at least for all of our more conspicuous fungi, determine
the family and genus. If the student can do so much, the task of finding
the specific name, even when not included in this book, becomes
very much simpler.</p>

<p class='c000'>So much for the more scientific aspect of my book. But I have
also kept in constant view the needs of the large and constantly growing
number of persons who have no aim further than to learn to know the
principal toadstools seen in their walks, just as they wish to know the
principal trees and the more conspicuous birds. For such as these, the
difficulty of deciding whether or no a particular individual fungus is
described in the brief (sketching) manuals hitherto accessible is even
more formidable than with the special student of botany.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, I have kept in view throughout the work the needs of the
mycophagists. They are not pot-hunters; they care much less for the
physical pleasure of the appetite than for the close study of Nature
that their inclination leads them into. Some day the delights of a
mushroom hunt along lush pastures and rich woodlands will take the
rank of the gentlest craft among those of hunting, and may perchance
find its own Izaak Walton.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the intention of the author and the publisher to keep this book
up to date. Recognizing that future testing will prove many more
species of toadstools to be edible, and that scientists will have more
exact knowledge of toadstool poisons and their antidotes, they announce
that illustrated sheets publishing new edible species and current information
upon fungi will be, from time to time, issued, conforming in shape
and style to this volume and at an acceptable price.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the author and publishers may keep in touch with the owner of

  <h2 class='c004'>INSTRUCTIONS TO STUDENTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>To catch fish one must know more than the fish; to find toadstools
one must know their season and habitats. They are propagated by their
spores and from their mycelium—that web-like growth which is the result
of spore germination.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spores of ground-growing kinds, when shed upon the ground,
are washed by rains along the natural drainage; therefore, when a specimen
of one of these kinds is found, it is well to look up and down the
natural water-shed, and follow it. Good reward will usually come of it.
Few fungi are strictly solitary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Careful observation of the habitats of the various genera and species
will enable the student to know what may and may not be expected in
a particular locality, and will save many a hunt.</p>

<p class='c000'>When an unknown species is found, collect it carefully, examine it
closely, note all its features. Determine to which division of fungi it
belongs. If to the gilled family (Agaricaceæ) obtain the color of the
spores (see directions). Look at the chart “Tabular View of Genera
of Agaricaceæ,” Plate <a href='#plate001'>I</a>, p. 2 (after W.G. Smith, but enlarged, redrawn
and emended). If the spores are white, it belongs to one of the genera
in the first column—Leucosporæ; if pink, to one in the second column,
and so on. It is often difficult to determine the spore color, because
spores vary through many shades of the typical color. What are called
white spores may be creamy, dirty, yellowish or brownish-white; pink
spores will vary from almost white to reddish and salmon-color; brown
spores from light-ochraceous through cinnamon to rusty; purple spores
from dark-violet to purplish-black. Experience alone will enable the
student to decide which color series is present. The Genera Charts, preceding
the five different color series, show typical spore colors only.
Again, authors describing the species frequently fail to see colors alike;
if they do, their names for them frequently vary. For instance, few
persons will agree upon a color expressed as “livid.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>The color system principally used by botanists is Saccardo’s “Chromotaxia,”
costing fifty cents. It is decidedly inadequate. Ridgway’s
“Nomenclature of Colors for Naturalists” is far better, but it is out of
print and obtainable only at the principal libraries. “The Prang Standard
of Color” is the most complete ever issued, but it is inapplicable to
existing descriptions of fungi.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Make and Preserve Spore Prints.</div>

<p class='c000'>Take, to print upon, sheets of Bristol-board or any stiff, hard-surfaced
white paper 6×9 inches or larger. Cut a round
hole, four inches in diameter, in one of the sheets. Use
this as a stencil. Lay it upon a print-sheet and where
the opening occurs, paint with a weak solution of gum arabic—⅛ oz.
(one teaspoonful) to one pint of water. Dry the print-sheets.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a spore-print is to be taken, select a fully-grown specimen, remove
the stem, place the spore-bearing surface upon the gummed
paper, cover tightly with an inverted bowl or saucer, and allow to stand
undisturbed for eight or ten hours. The moisture in the plant will
soften the gummed surface; the spores will be shed and will adhere to
it, making a perfect, permanent print. When the print is plain, remove
the specimen carefully and dry the print. Number the print-cards to
correspond with the number of the specimen in the “Record of Fungi,”
and place them in a box or cover. Some genera shed their spores sooner
and more freely than others. A surplus of spores is objectionable. In
order to know when a print is plainly made, without disturbing the
process, have either a specimen of the same age, or a piece of the one
under the bowl, on another piece of gummed paper, covered in like
manner. This can be examined and will give the desired information.
A little experience will enable the student to obtain good and lasting
prints.</p>

<p class='c000'>The large black figures on some calendars, if cut with the white about
them, are convenient as trial sheets for spore-printing. Lay the specimen
partly on the white, partly on the black. If the spores are light,
they show best on black ground, and if colored, they show best on the
light.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spore measurements, as given by different observers, vary to such a
degree that they are of little value, excepting as determining a few
species, but spore shapes and characteristics are of use as a last resort,
in accurate determinations. A microscope of considerable power is
needed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>A metrical scale and table of measures is here given, that the student
may have a present guide to such measurements as are given in mycological
publications.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Use of Charts of Genera.</div>

<p class='c000'>The spore color being determined, turn to the Genera Chart, showing
spores of like color. Ascertain from the specimen whether
or not its cap or hymenophore is distinct or easily separable
from the stem and the gills free from the stem; if they are, it
may belong to one of the genera in the upper row of figures; if the cap
is not easily separable nor the gills free, look at the shape of the gills,
and find on the chart a corresponding gill-shape. It is probable that
the genus can thus be determined. Then turn to this genus in the text,
read the heading, look over the “Analysis of Tribes,” go to the tribe
nearest in designating the properties of the specimen; comparing the
specimen with the descriptions of species given thereunder, will probably
enable the seeker to decide upon its name.</p>

<p class='c000'>It should be remembered that the descriptions in the text are of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>specimen or specimens which the author of the species saw. What the
author says fixes the type of the species. Specimens of the species
may, and very frequently do, vary greatly from the type. If the first
attempt to fix the genus is not satisfactory, try again, and keep on trying
until reasonably sure. The amateur will find, however good an
opinion may exist in his mind of the stock of patience on hand, that the
territory of patience has just been reached.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Making and Preserving Notes.</div>

<p class='c000'>An excellent blank form for “Collectors’ Notes” is published by the
Boston Mycological Club, at one cent. It is desirable
that there should be uniformity in collectors’ notes, and
that they should be as full as possible. A form of this, or
a similar kind, should be filled in and kept, and should also be used
when specimens are sent to an expert for identification. Such specimens
should be fresh, wrapped separately in tissue paper, numbered, and <em>a
few</em> should be packed in a box that will <em>not crush in the mail</em>. The
address of the sender should be upon the outside. The collector’s
notes should be sent in a letter, with a postage stamp for reply enclosed.
If the specimens have to go a great distance, they should be partially
dried in a slow, open oven, or they will be a rotten mass when they
reach their destination.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>To Test Edibility of Species.</div>

<p class='c000'>There is but one way by which to determine the edibility of a species.
If it looks and smells inviting, and its species can not be
determined, taste a very small piece. Do not swallow it.
Note the effect on the tongue and mouth. But many
species, delicious when cooked, are not inviting raw. Cook a small
piece; do not season it. Taste again; if agreeable eat it (unless it is
an Amanita). After several hours, no unpleasant effect arising, cook a
larger piece, and increase the quantity until fully satisfied as to its
qualities. Never vary from this system, no matter how much tempted.
No possible danger can arise from adhering firmly to it. Recipes for
preparing, cooking and serving are given in chapter on cooking.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is better for the student to first become familiar with the common
species, one at a time, than to attempt tracing the rare or many.
Worry, fatigue and uncertainty are plentiful in an indiscriminate gathering
of fungi. One species a day, properly traced and named, means
learning three hundred and sixty-five species a year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Glossary.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>Unfamiliar terms will be encountered in the descriptive text. The
Glossary defines them; and not only those in this book,
but, it is believed, all those found in other books upon
fungi. Where possible throughout the text, botanical terms have been
anglicized. The meanings of those remaining unchanged should be
memorized. It is quite as easy, and far better, to learn the botanical
names of species and their characteristics, as to learn their common
names; easier in fact, for the common names often vary with locality.
The writer received a letter from an Alsatian living in St. Louis, telling
him of favorite fungi he used to eat when in his own country. To all
he gave local names, not one of which could be referred to the particular
species meant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Success and pleasure in the study of fungi will attend the student
who observes carefully and who systematically records that which is
observed.</p>

Fungi composed of membranes, fleshy, woody or gelatinous,
growing on wood or on the ground. The hymenium
or spore-bearing surface exposed at an early stage. The
spores are borne on basidia, spread over the surface.
The common mushroom is typical of the family. All the
members resemble it, more or less, in organization and reproductive
organs. These latter, in the mushroom, are spread over lamellæ or
gills. The spores, after ripening and dissemination, germinate and
produce a mycelium or thread-like vine, which in turn develops the
spore-producing part of the plant. Hymenomycetes is divided into the
following six Families:—</p>

<h3 class='c025'>FAMILY I.—<strong>AGARICACEÆ.</strong></h3>

<p class='c026'>In the Agaricaceæ the hymenium is spread over lamellæ or gills
which radiate from a center or stem. The gills are composed of a
double membrane, and are simple or branched.</p>

<p class='c000'>The parts of an Agaric may all be present as in Amanitæ, or severally
absent in other genera. When the young fungus is entirely enclosed in
a wrapper or case, this case is called the <em>universal veil</em>. When this
veil is ruptured by the growth of the stem, that part which remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>attached to the base is called the <em>volva</em>. The membrane reaching from
the stem to the margin of the cap is the <em>partial veil</em>; when it ruptures
by the expansion of the cap and all or a portion adheres to and about
the stem it forms the <em>annulus or ring</em>. In some species one or both
veils may be present, or one or both may be absent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stem is <em>central</em> when supporting the cap at its center; <em>excentric</em>
when at one side of the center; <em>lateral</em> when it supports the cap from
the side. If the stem is absent, the cap is said to be <em>sessile</em>; if the cap
is horizontal and supported by a broad base it is <em>dimidiate</em>; if attached
to its place of growth by its back it is <em>resupinate</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Genera are largely distinguished by the manner in which the gills are
attached to the stem. These distinguishing attachments are shown in
the plates illustrating genera and in Plate <a href='#plate004'>IV</a>. Gill-shapes.</p>

<p class='c000'>For convenience Agaricaceæ is divided by the color of the spores into
five series: white, pink, brown, purple, black. The last two, owing
to the similarity of hue, are by some writers (preferably) included in
the black-spored series. Spore color is a valuable assistant in determining
species.</p>

<h4 class='c027'><em>Series I.</em> <strong>LEUCOSPORÆ.</strong> <i>Gr.</i>—white; <i>Gr.</i>—seed.</h4>

<p class='c026'>Spores white, rarely dingy or inclining to reddish. In the genus
Russula the spores of some species are white, in some cream-color, and
in several pale ochraceous. Variations from pure white are found in
the spores of Tricholoma personatum and a few other species. Gill-color
is not a guide to spore-color. Purple, yellow, brown, pinkish
gills may produce white spores.</p>

as patches or scales, the remainder enclosing the stem at the
base as a volva, either in a cup-like
form, closely adherent or friable

youth extends from the stem to the
margin of the pileus, enclosing the
gills; when ruptured it depends from
the stem as a ring. <strong>Stem</strong> furnished
with a ring, and different in substance

<p class='c000'>On the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nearest allied genus, Amanitopsis,
is separated by the absence
of a ring, and Lepiota by its lack
of a volva; Volvaria, Acetabularia
and Chitonia, possessing volvas,
are distinguished by the color of
their spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amanitæ are the most beautiful and conspicuous of fungi. While
there are comparatively few species of them, the individual members
are plentiful in appearing from spring until the coming of frost. They
are solitary or gregarious in growth. Occasionally two or three are
found together. They frequent woods, groves, copse, margins of woods
and land recently cleared of trees. They are seldom found in open
fields. A careful study of all their botanic points should be the first
duty of the student of fungi. Familiarity with every characteristic of
the Amanitæ will insure against fatal toadstool poisoning, for it is the
well-grounded belief of those who have made thorough investigation
that, with the exception of Helvella esculenta, now Gyromitra esculenta,
the Amanitæ, alone, contain deadly poisons.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>No Amanita, or piece of one, should be eaten before its identity is fully
established and its qualities ascertained by referring to the descriptions
herein given or to the opinion of an expert.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>They are the aristocrats of fungi. Their noble bearing, their beauty,
their power for good or evil, and above all their perfect structure, have
placed them first in their realm; and they proudly bear the three badges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of their clan and rank—the volva or sheath from which they spring, the
kid-like apron encircling their waists, and patch-marks of their high
birth upon their caps. In their youth, when in or just appearing above
the ground, they are completely invested with a membrane or universal
veil, which is distinct and free from the skin of the cap. As the plant
grows the membrane stretches and finally bursts. It sometimes ruptures
in one place only and remains about the base of the stem as the volva.
When such a rupture occurs the caps are smooth. In most species portions
of the volva remain upon the cap as scruff or warts—pointed or
rough—or as feathery adornment; any or all of which may in part or
whole vanish with age or be washed away by rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Extending from the stem to the margin of the cap, and covering the
gills, is the partial <strong>veil</strong>—a membranaceous, white texture of varying
thickness. As the cap expands this veil tears from it. Portions frequently
remain pendant from the edges, the rest contracts to the stem
as a ring, or droops from it as a surrounding ruffle, or, if of slight consistency,
may be fugacious and disappear, but marks, remains, or the
veil itself will always be traceable upon the stem.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Amanitæ are of all colors, from the brilliant orange of the A.
Cæsarea, the rich scarlet or crimson of the A. muscaria, to the pure
white of the A. phalloides in its white form.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their stems are usually long, and taper from the base toward the top.
In some forms the base is distinctly bulbous. The <strong>volva</strong> at the base is
attached to the stem at its lower extremity. It may be visible as a
cup or ruptured pouch with spreading mouth, or it may be of such
friable texture as to appear like mealy scales. Often, when the plant
is pulled from the ground, the volva remains, but the marks of its
attachment will appear and should be carefully looked for. Their <strong>gills</strong>
are commonly white, are of equal length and radiate from near the
stem, which they do not reach, to the circumference of the cap. They
are white, unless tinged with age, excepting upon A. Cæsarea and A.
Frostiana where they are yellow.<a id='rB' /><a href='#fB' class='c019'><sup>[B]</sup></a> Their caps are umbrella-shaped, flat
or convex. Their flesh is white, does not change color when bruised.
They are scentless and almost tasteless when fresh, when old they have
a slightly offensive odor and taste.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fB'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#rB'>B</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A. Frostiana is not always yellow gilled.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The family is not a large one, not over thirty members complete its
circle. Every feature, every part of its several members, should be
thoroughly known before the intimacy of eating. While at least nine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of the family are not only edible but delicate and sapid, far better will
it be to leave all alone than to make a mistake. A piece of a poisonous
variety the size of a dime will often cause serious disorders if eaten.
Many persons have died from eating very small quantities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Because of its ovate or button-like form when young, it is frequently
mistaken for the common field mushroom; even experienced mycophagists
have been deceived by it. No other poison has so puzzled
scientists. Other varieties of fungi may interfere with digestion, but to
the Amanitæ all deaths from toadstool-eating are traceable. Its subtle
alkaloid is absorbed by the system, and in most cases lies unsuspected
for from six to twelve hours, then its iron grip holds to the death. For
centuries it has defied all remedies. The problem has been partially
solved. At Shenandoah, Pa., August 31, 1885, a family of five were
poisoned by toadstools; two died, three lived. Noting the sad account
in the newspapers, I at once wrote to Shenandoah for specimens of the
fungi eaten and a description of the treatment. I promptly received
from Dr. J.E. Schadle (now Professor Schadle), the physician in
charge of the cases, a box containing two harmless varieties and several
fine specimens of the Amanita phalloides, all of which were gathered
on the same spot and by the same person who gathered the toadstools
doing the poisoning. They told the tale. A remarkably full
and interesting account of the cases was sent to me by Dr. Schadle.
After exhausting all other remedies, and after two of the five had died,
he administered subcutaneously, by hypodermic injection, sulphate of
atropine—a product of the deadly nightshade analagous to belladonna—<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>180</sub>
to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>60</sub> of a grain at a dose. It proved to be an antidote and
saved the lives of the remaining three.</p>

<p class='c000'>The action of atropine in arresting the deadly work of poisoning by
amanitine had been foreshadowed by Schmidberg and Koppe, and
dwelt upon in numerous published articles by Mr. Julius A. Palmer, to
whom more than any other is due the branding of the murderous members
of the Amanita family; but for the first time atropine was used
upon the human system to ward their blows.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of the species herein described are found in the United States.
Of the twenty-seven, nine are edible, nine are either known to be deadly
or are so closely allied to deadly species that it is unsafe to class them
as other than poisonous until absolute proof is obtained of their harmlessness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The remaining nine I have not seen, neither is there any record

<p class='c000'><strong>Plant</strong> 4–8 in. high. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2–5 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 3–6 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>This species is common and variable. It occurs everywhere in woods
and assumes such different colors that the inexperienced mycologist is
apt to mistake its different forms for distinct species. With us the prevailing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>colors of the pileus are white, yellowish-white, grayish-brown
and blackish-brown. It is remarkable that the form with a greenish
pileus, which seems to be common enough in Europe, does not occur
here. Fries also mentions a form having a white pileus with a black
disk. A somewhat similar form occurs here, in which the pileus is
grayish-brown with a black disk. Some of the variously colored forms
were formerly taken to be distinct species, in consequence of which
several synonyms have arisen, of which A. virescens Fl. Dan., Amanita
viridis Pers., and Amanita citrina Pers., are examples. A. verna
Bull. is a variety having a white pileus, a rather thick annulus and an
appressed volva. It sometimes occurs early in the season; hence the
specific name. It also occurs late in the season and runs into the typical
form so that it is not easy to keep it distinct. The flesh and the lamellæ
are white, the stem is white, pallid or brownish, and the annulus is
either white or brownish. The bulb is generally very broad and abrupt
or depressed, though it sometimes is small and approaches an ovate
form. The large bulbs are sometimes split externally in two or three
places and are, therefore, two- or three-lobed. In such cases the volva
is less persistent than usual and its free portion then furnishes merely an
acute edge or narrow margin to the bulb. Specimens sometimes occur
in which the margin of the pileus is narrowly adorned with a slight
woolly hairiness, but usually it is perfectly smooth and even. By this
character, taken in connection with the membranous volva and bulbous
base of the stem, the species is readily distinguished. Sometimes a
strong odor is emitted by it, but usually the odor is slight. Authors
generally pronounce this a poisonous and very dangerous species. Its
appearance is attractive, but its use as food is to be avoided. <cite>Peck</cite>,
33d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Common in woods and recently cleared woodlands. Frequent over
the United States. June to frost.</p>

<p class='c000'>An exceedingly <em>poisonous, dangerous</em>, seductive species, responsible
for most of the deaths from toadstool eating; because in its white form
it is mistaken for the common mushroom—Agaricus campester. The
real fault is with the collector, who should never eat any fungus found
in the woods, believing it to be the mushroom. The mushroom does
not grow in the woods. Neither has it <em>white gills</em>, nor <em>white spores</em>, nor
a <em>volva</em> at the base of the stem as have Amanitæ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The caps of A. phalloides vary in color—white, oyster-color, smoky
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>brown. The color of the commonest form is from white to a light hue
of greenish yellow. The center of the cap, whatever may be the prevailing
color, is usually several shades darker.  In shape, the cap
changes from a knob in youth, through the shapes of expansion, until
it becomes fully spread, when it is umbrella-shaped, or almost flat.
Some forms have a slightly raised portion or umbo in the center of the
cap. The gills are white, of good width, rounded next to the stem and
free from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stem conforms in color to the cap, but in lighter shades. White-capped
varieties have white stems. The stem has a sudden broad, distinct
bulb at the base. On the upper side of the bulb there is usually a
margin or rim. The stem tapers more or less toward the cap, from
which it is easily separable. The cup, wrapper or volva is torn or split
or irregular at the upper part, and is not pressed to the stem as in some
forms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck, in his 48th Report, gives the following excellent synopsis
of differences between the poisonous Amanita and edible fungi, for
which it could only by great stupidity be mistaken:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Poison amanita.</em> <strong>Gills</strong> persistently white. <strong>Stem</strong> equal to or longer
than the diameter of the cap, with a broad, distinct bulb at the base.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Common mushroom.</em> <strong>Gills</strong> pink, becoming blackish-brown. <strong>Stem</strong>
shorter than the diameter of the cap, with no bulb at the base.</p>

<p class='c000'>From all forms of the edible Sheathed amanitopsis the Poison amanita
differs in its distinctly bulbous stem, in having a collar on the stem
and in the absence of striations on the margin of the cap.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the edible Reddish amanita, it is easily separated by the entire
absence of any reddish hues or stains and of warts upon its cap.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the Smooth lepiota its distinct, abrupt and marginal bulb at
once distinguishes it.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>A. ver´na</strong> Bull.—<em>vernus</em>, of spring. A variety of A. phalloides.
POISONOUS. White. <strong>Pileus</strong> ovate then expanded, somewhat depressed,

<p class='c000'>The Vernal Amanita scarcely differs from white forms of the A.
phalloides except in the more persistent and more closely sheathing
remains of the wrapper at the base of the stem. It is probably only a
variety of that species, as most mycologists now regard it, and it should
be considered quite as dangerous. I have not found it earlier than in
July, although in Europe it is said to appear in spring, as its name implies.

<p class='c000'>This emperor of fungi is the most showy of its race. It grows to 10
in. in height. The cap reaches 8 in. in diameter and the stem over 1½
in. in thickness. In very much smaller specimens about the same proportions
occur. The cap is at first ovate, then hemispherical, then expanded.
It has no warts or scales upon it. The margin is distinctly
striate. The flesh is white, yellow or reddish under the skin; next to
the gills it is usually yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stem tapers upward from the socket at its base. It is yellowish
and covered with loose fibrils of darker hue. The ring is white, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>frequently tinged with yellow. In taste and smell it is mild. Open
woods is its favorite habitat, yet it is found growing luxuriantly under
pines, maples, elms, on lawns. It is not often found, but when it is, it
is solitary, or in groups or rings. In the latitude of Philadelphia it is
found from July until October 1st. Further south its stay conforms to
temperature, and it is more frequent. There is no doubt of its rare
edibility abroad, and of its being eaten in America.</p>

<p class='c000'>A specimen believed to be it should never be eaten until carefully
distinguished from A. muscaria and A. Frostiana, which have warts or
scales on the cap (which sometimes are not discernible after rain),
white gills, and a volva which soon breaks up into fragments or scabs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Appearing like a small form of A. muscaria, to which it was formerly
referred, is A. Frostiana Pk. (Frost’s Agaric). It closely resembles
small A. Cæsarea, especially in the yellow tinge of stem, ring and gills.
The volva and ring (persistent in A. Cæsarea) soon disappear, but are
traceable by fluffy fragments, or yellow stains. It is extremely poisonous.</p>

<p class='c000'>The differences, concisely, are these: A. Cæsarea (Orange Amanita).
<strong>Cap</strong> smooth, though occasionally with a few fragments of the volva as
patches upon it. <strong>Gills</strong> yellow. <strong>Stem</strong> yellow. <strong>Volva</strong> usually persistent,
sometimes breaking up into soft, fluffy masses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A. muscaria</em> (Fly Amanita). Poisonous. <strong>Cap</strong> covered with remains
of the volva as scales or wart-like patches. <strong>Gills</strong> white. <strong>Stem</strong> white or
light-yellow. <strong>Volva</strong> not persistent, breaking up into fluffy fragments
or scales.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A. Frostiana.</em> Poisonous. Smaller and more delicate than the two
preceding. <strong>Cap</strong> smooth or with yellow scales or wart-like patches.
<strong>Gills</strong> yellow or tinged on edge with yellow. <strong>Stem</strong> white or yellow,
the ring evanescent, but always leaving a yellow mark on stem. <strong>Volva</strong>
yellow, breaking up into yellow fluffy fragments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Far better for the amateur to let the A. Cæsarea, and anything resembling
it, respectfully alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rogues and Cordier, French writers, regard it as the finest and most

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The writer has not had opportunity to eat A. Cæsarea. If such
should occur he would go about it very cautiously. No suspicion
attaches to it abroad, but evidence is accumulating in the hands of the
writer (not yet convincing) that either locality may render it poisonous
or that A. muscaria varies so much in appearance as to deceive even
the expert into mistaking it for A. Cæsarea. It is possible that A.
muscaria is, at times, in certain localities, harmless; but no such exception
as this is noted in the entire fungoid realm. It is not so common
that collectors should mourn its waste. It is better, far, to let it alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At Cincinnati, yellow A. muscaria are all we find.” <cite>Lloyd.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Reported from most of the states. At Mt. Gretna I found it in great
quantity, and frequently three or four tightly crowded together. Many
pounds of it were sent to Professor Chittenden, Sheffield Laboratory,
Yale University. Near Haddonfield, N.J., large patches annually
grow under pines, gorgeous in their rich orange-red caps, usually scaly,
with at times lemon-yellow in the same clusters, smooth as A. Cæsarea.
It grows from July until after hard frosts.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is undoubtedly <em>poisonous</em> to a high degree. Its juices in minute
quantity, carefully and scientifically injected into the circulation of etherized
cats, kill in less than a minute. A raw piece of the cap, the size
of a hazel nut, affects me sensibly if taken on an empty stomach. Dizziness,
nausea, exaggeration of vision and pallor result from it. The
pulse quickens and is full, and a dreaded pressure affects the breathing.
I have not noticed change in the pupil of the eye. Nicotine from
smoking a pipe with me abates the symptoms, which entirely disappear
in two hours, leaving as reminiscence a torturing, dull, skull-pervading
headache. If, as is asserted on good authority, the Siberians
use it as an intoxicant, they certainly suffer the accustomed penalty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>It is possible that persons may, in a degree, become immune to its poison,
as they do to arsenic, strychnia, opium, nicotine, or it may be that
a portion of the poison is extracted by boiling. It is, however, extremely
dangerous to rely upon extracting by any means the poison of
the Amanita, and to eat the residue. Acetic acid or vinegar does <em>not</em>
destroy the poison; it dissolves it to an extent and extracts it, and becomes
as poisonous as the plant itself. There is no means of telling
how much of the poison remains in the plant after such treatment. The
safe plan is to eat, only, of toadstools which do not contain any poison
to extract.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>A. Frost´iana</strong> Pk.—in honor of Charles C. Frost. POISONOUS.
(Plate <a href='#plate006'>VI</a>, fig. 5, p. 6.) <strong>Pileus</strong> convex or expanded, bright-orange or
yellow, warty, sometimes nearly or quite smooth, striate on the margin.
<strong>Gills</strong> free, white or slightly tinged with yellow. <strong>Stem</strong> white or yellow,
stuffed, bearing a slight, sometimes evanescent ring, bulbous at the base,
the bulb <em>slightly margined</em> by the volva. <strong>Spores</strong> <em>globose</em>, 8–10µ in

<p class='c000'>This appears like a very small form of the Fly Agaric, to which, as
var. minor, it was formerly referred. The only decided characters for
distinguishing it are its small size and globose spores. Our plant sometimes
grows in company with A. muscaria, but it seems to prefer more
dense woods, especially mixed or hemlock woods. It is generally very
regular and beautiful and has the stem quite often of a yellow color, and
the bulb margined above with a collar-like ring. <cite>Peck</cite>, 33d Rep. N.Y.

<p class='c000'>West Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina, <cite>McIlvaine</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Frostiana is found well over the land. It is frequent in shady
woods and seems to favor ground under the prevailing tree—oak, chestnut,
pine, hemlock, whichever it may be. From the many hundreds
I have seen, I think it more likely to be mistaken by the novice for A.
Cæsarea than A. muscaria, because of its often yellow gills and stem.
It is much smaller and thinner than either. In the states I have found
it, it is darker than described, being a rich reddish-orange or scarlet.
The partial veil or ring is very evanescent but often found upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>stem as a yellow, floccose remnant. The stain of the ring is always
noticeable. The volva is seldom found entire. It, too, is evanescent,
but, like the veil, is found yellow and fluffy, adhering to the fingers
when touched.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is probable that its highly colored cap has caused it to be gathered
by the careless collector of bright-capped Russulæ, and that thus R.
emetica got its bad name. Examine carefully any toadstool resembling
it. The Russulæ have neither ring nor volva.</p>

the surface is often <em>wrinkled-papillose</em>, or in a peculiar manner hollowed
and pitted, sprinkled with angular, unequal, whitish-gray, easily separating
warts, the remains of the friable volva; margin at first even,
but when properly developed manifestly striate, even furrowed. <strong>Flesh</strong>
soft, white throughout, unchangeable. <strong>Stem</strong> 4–6 in. long, 1 in. thick,
at first stuffed, almost solid, but at length hollow, globose-depressed at
the base, attenuated upward from the bulb, covered, sometimes as far
as the ring, sometimes only on the lower part with <em>dense, squarrose, concentric
scales</em> (from the epidermis of the stem being torn), striate at the
apex. <strong>Ring</strong> superior, large, separating-free or at length torn. <strong>Gills</strong>
quite <em>free, rounded</em> (not decurrent on the stem in the form of lines),
very ventricose, ½ in. and more broad, shining white.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>bulb when young</em> is <em>somewhat marginate</em>, but by no means separable,
the margin proper, like that of A. muscaria, is marked with
scales, buried in the soil, somewhat rooting, beneath the margin marked
here and there with a concentric furrow. The shorter gills intermixed
are more numerous than is usual among Amanitæ. There is a smaller

grows singly, but when one is found several are apt to be neighbors.
When young, the cap is but a small knob upon a beet or top-shaped
base, which is largely under ground. It cuts like a soft turnip, and has
a strong, pungent, unmistakable odor, like chloride of lime, which entirely
disappears in cooking. As the plant develops the bulb decreases
in size. On all the many specimens the author has seen and eaten, the

warts which are generally numerous, but often falling off or few and
scattered. The flesh is white and smells like chloride of lime, but not
nearly so strong as A. strobiliformis. The volva is broken up into
floccose scales which cling to bulb and lower part of stem. These scales
may be white and mealy or brownish. The entire fungus has a fluffy
exterior, which is easily removed by rubbing. The annulus is torn, a
part often adhering to the margin of the pileus and the gills. This and
the long, tapering, rooting bulb are marked characteristics. The bulb
is brittle. It is difficult to get the fungus from the ground entire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stem and cap are juicy, tender, mild in flavor, wholesome. It is not

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>This is a fine large species related to A. solitaria, but differing from
it in the character of its bulb and of its annulus. The bulb is not marginate
nor imbricately squamose. Its scales are small and numerous.
Nor is it clearly radicating, though sometimes it has a slight abrupt
point or myceloid-agglomerated mass of soil at its base. The veil or
annulus is large and well developed, but it is apt to fall away and disappear
with age. Its attachment at the very top of the stem brings it
closely in contact with the lamellæ of the young plant and the striations
of its upper surface appear to be due to the pressure of the edges of
these upon it. It separates readily from the margin of the pileus and is
not lacerated. In the mature plant the warts have generally disappeared
from the pileus and sometimes its margin is curved upward

<p class='c000'>It is quite common, often growing in large patches. Recent authors
agree upon the edibility and deliciousness of this species. The author
knows it to be one of the most plentiful, useful and delicious, after several
years of pleasant experience with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In July, 1899, at Mt. Gretna, I found, growing from the ground gregariously,
a singular fungoid growth from 2–5 in. high; cap hemispherical,
1 in. in diameter, tightly fitting a solid stem of nearly the
diameter of the cap. The whole was watery white, and evidently affected
by a parasite. It was edible. September 1st Professor Peck
wrote to me: “I think I have found the identity of the diseased
Agaric, of which you sent me samples some time ago. I mean the one
affected by <em>Hypomyces inæqualis</em> Pk. The host is Amanita rubescens,
at least sometimes, and probably always.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The plant is very heavy for its size. The lack of a volva, the dingy
color and reddish stains distinctly separate this from any poisonous
Amanita.</p>

even, but often torn into fibers. <strong>Flesh</strong> <em>firm, white, quite unchangeable</em>.
<strong>Stem</strong> 2–3 in. long, as much as 1 in. thick, <em>solid, turnip-shaped
at the base</em>, somewhat rooting with a globoso-depressed not marginate
bulb, curt, firm, shining white, at length <em>squamulose with concentric

<p class='c000'>Taste and smell strong, but when cooked the dish is savory and not
unlike one of A. rubescens.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>A. as´pera</strong>  Fr.—<em>asper</em>, rough. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2–3 in. across. <strong>Flesh</strong> rather
thick at the disk, whitish, white or reddish with tints of livid or gray,
<em>reddish or brownish under the cuticle</em>; convex then plane, margin thin
and even, rough with firmly adnate, minute, closely crowded, angular
warts, reddish-brown or livid-brownish, not pure white, unchangeable.
<strong>Gills</strong> free and rounded behind, not striately decurrent, ventricose, white.
<strong>Stem</strong> stuffed, striate above the ring, short at first, ovate, then elongating
to 2–3 in., attenuated upward from a wrinkled bulb, squamulose,
white without and within. <strong>Ring</strong> superior, entire.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> 8×6µ <cite>Massee</cite>; 8×6–7µ <cite>W.G.S.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>The flesh of stem and bulb when eaten by insects is reddish, the bulb
when old is a reddish-brown. The large ring and stem become red
when touched. In these particulars it resembles A. rubescens. In smell
it is somewhat strong, not unlike A. strobiliformis, but not nearly so
pungent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cooked it is of excellent quality and flavor. I have eaten it since 1885.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>A. abrup´ta</strong> Pk.—abrupt, of the bulb. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin, broadly convex
or nearly plane, covered with small angular or pyramidal, erect, somewhat
evanescent warts, white, slightly striate on the margin. <strong>Flesh</strong>
white. <strong>Gills</strong> moderately close, reaching the stem and sometimes terminating
in slightly decurrent lines upon it, white. <strong>Stem</strong> slender, glabrous,
solid, bulbous, white, the bulb abrupt, subglobose, often coated
below by the white persistent mycelium, the ring membranous, persistent.
<strong>Spores</strong> broadly elliptical or subglobose, 8–10×6–8µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 2–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 2.5–4 in. long, 3–4 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief distinguishing mark of this species is the abrupt, nearly
globose, bulbous base of the stem. This is somewhat flattened above
and is sometimes longitudinally split on the sides. The small warts of
the pileus are easily separable, and in mature specimens they have often
wholly or partly disappeared. The remains of the volva are not present
on the bulb in mature dried specimens, which indicates that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>species should be placed in the same group with A. rubescens, A.
spissa, etc. The latter species have the bulb of the stem similar to that
of our plant, but the color of the pileus and other characters easily separate
it. <cite>Peck</cite>, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a large and interesting species, well marked and easily recognized
by its large size, by the greenish tint that pervades the pileus,
lamellæ, annulus and stem, and especially by the large persistent patch
of grayish-white felty material that covers the center of the pileus and
sometimes extends nearly to the margin. This is in fact the upper part
of the ruptured volva that is carried up by the growing plant, and is
very suggestive of the specific name. In the young state the plant is
entirely enveloped in the volva, which then is similar to a goose egg in
size and shape, and its walls are one-fourth to one-half inch thick. So
thick and firm are they that the young plant appears sometimes to be
unable to break through and it decays in its infancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Lane says that, having found that the Italians made use of this
mushroom for food, he began eating it and introducing it to his friends,
and he learned by personal trial that it is a thoroughly good and wholesome
mushroom, which, when broiled with bacon, fried, baked or
stewed, may be eaten with perfect safety and that it is a nutritious food.

<p class='c000'>The volva in this species must be very slight, as its remains quickly
disappear from the bulb of the stem. The remains carried up by the
pileus form slight warts or thin whitish areolate patches. The annulus
is present in very young plants, but is often wanting in mature ones, in
which state the plant might be mistaken for a species of Amanitopsis.
Its true affinity is with the tribe to which A. rubescens belongs. As in
that species, the bulb soon becomes naked and exhibits no remains of
the volva. It is similar to A. farinosa also in this respect, but quite
unlike it in color, in the adornments of the pileus and in the character
of its margin, which is even in the young plant and but slightly striate
in the mature state. Its dimensions are said sometimes to exceed those
here given, and it is reported to have been eaten without harm and to
be of an excellent flavor. I have had no opportunity to try. <cite>Peck</cite>,

<p class='c000'>Close observation is necessary in collecting Amanitopsis for the table.
<em>It has no trace of ring or veil upon the stem.</em> So far as the species are
known no poisonous one exists. But Amanita spreta Pk., which is
deadly, so closely resembles forms of Amanitopsis that those confident
of their knowledge will be deceived. The veil or traces of veil, which
Amanita spreta always has, sometimes so adheres to and wraps the stem
that it is not noticeable without close examination, thus giving to it
every appearance of an Amanitopsis.</p>

<p class='c000'>The volva of A. spreta is attached for a considerable distance to the
base of the tapering stem, and is not readily removed. This is a guide
to detect it. It is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amanitopsis corresponds to Volvaria in the pink-spored series, in
which, as far as known, there is no poisonous species.</p>

sometimes tinged with yellow or ochraceous on the disk. <strong>Flesh</strong> white.
<strong>Gills</strong> subdistant, white, free. <strong>Stem</strong> equal, rather tall, nearly smooth,
<em>bulbous</em>, stuffed, white; the volva very fragile, <em>soon breaking up into

<p class='c000'>This fungus is closely related to A. vaginata, from which it may be

tooth. Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 22, No. 12.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it is probable this species will be found elsewhere than California,
and from its close relation to A. vaginata likely to be edible, its description
is here given.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Pileus</strong> <em>generally scaly</em> from the breaking up of the cuticle and the
adherence of the concrete veil. <strong>Gills</strong> free, often very distant from the
stem and attached to a <em>cartilaginous</em>
collar. <strong>Stem</strong> hollow or stuffed,
its flesh distinct from that of the
pileus. <strong>Ring</strong> at first attached to
the cuticle of the pileus, often movable,
sometimes evanescent.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the ground. Several are found
in hot-houses and hot-beds, and are
probably introduced species.</p>

<p class='c000'>The universal veil, covering the
entire plant when very young, is
closely applied to the pileus, which
from the breaking up of the cuticle
is generally scaly.  The <strong>stem</strong> in
most species differs in substance
from the pileus. This is readily
seen by splitting the plant in half
from cap to base. It is easily separated
from the cap, leaving a cup-like
depression therein. <strong>Gills</strong> usually
white. In some species they are yellow-tinted. In others they
become a dingy red when wounded or ageing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The veil in this genus, being concrete with the cuticle of the pileus,
never appears as loose warts or patches, neither is there a volva as in
Amanita and Amanitopsis. These three genera are the only ones in
the white-spored series having gills free from the stem. In a few species
the gills are slightly attached to the stem, but are never decurrent upon
it as in Armillaria. When the plant is young it is egg-shaped. It then
gradually spreads, becomes convex, and opens until it is nearly flat,
with a knob in the center.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only species in this genus known to be poisonous to some persons
is L. Morgani Pk., which is distinguished by its green spores and white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>gills becoming green. L. Vittadini has also been regarded with suspicion.</p>

The <strong>Flesh</strong> not very thick, soft, permanently white.
<strong>Pileus</strong> at first ovate, finally expanded, cuticle soon
breaking up into brown scales, excepting upon the
umbo, umbo smooth, dark-brown, distinct. The
caps vary in shades of brown, sometimes they
have a faint tinge of lavender. <strong>Gills</strong> whitish,
crowded, narrowing toward the stem, and very remote
from it. <strong>Stem</strong> variable in length, often very
long, tubular, at first stuffed with light fibrils,
quite bulbous at base, generally spotted or scaly with peculiar snake-like
markings below the ring, which is thick, firm and readily movable.
When the stem is removed from pileus it leaves a deep cavity extending
nearly to the cuticle.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 3–6 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 5–12 in. high, about ½ in. thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>White spores elliptical, 14–18×9–11µ <cite>Peck</cite>; 12–15×8–9µ <cite>Massee</cite>;

<p class='c000'>Readily known by its extremely tall stem, shaggy cap, distinct umbo
and the channel between the gills and stem. Resembles no poisonous
species.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before cooking the scurf should be rubbed from the caps, which alone
should be eaten, as the stem is tough. Though the flesh is thin, the
gills are meaty and have a pleasant, nutty flavor. Fried in butter it
has few equals. It makes a superior catsup.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. racho´des</strong> Vitt. <i>Gr.</i>—a ragged, tattered garment. <strong>Pileus</strong> very

but otherwise <em>soon becomes elegantly reticulated with cracks</em>; these very
<em>readily separate</em> into <em>persistent</em>, polygonal, concentric <em>scales</em>, which are
revolute at the margin and attached to the surface with beautifully
radiating fibers, the surface remaining coarsely fibrillose-downy. <strong>Flesh</strong>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>white, <em>immediately becoming saffron-red</em> when broken, easily separating

as a span long, very robust, 1 in. thick, and more at the base, always
even, and <em>without a trace of scales</em> or even of fibrils although the appearance
is obsoletely silky, wholly whitish, hollow within, stuffed with
spider-web threads, the walls remarkably and coarsely fibrous. <strong>Ring</strong>
movable, adhering longer to the margin of the pileus than to the apex
of the stem, hence rayed with fibers at the circumference, clothed
beneath with one or two zones of scales. <strong>Gills</strong> <em>very remote</em>, tapering
toward each end or broadest at the middle, crowded, whitish, sometimes
reddening. <cite>Stevenson.</cite></p>

sometimes areolate, more or less peeled toward margin, hence its name.
<strong>Gills</strong> ventricose, white, free, somewhat remote. <strong>Stem</strong> attenuated,

<p class='c000'>North Carolina, edible, <cite>Curtis</cite>. It is generally eaten in Europe.
In woods, especially about old stumps. October.</p>

<p class='c000'>The entire plant is whitish and is well marked by the prominent umbo,

up into broad adpressed scales, allows the whitish pileus to be seen beneath
them. <strong>Gills</strong> remote, very broad, crowded, pallid. <strong>Stem</strong> whitish,
obscurely scaly, hollow or containing slight fibrils, slightly bulbous.
<strong>Ring</strong> thin, floccose, vanishing.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Stem</strong> 5–6 in. long, 3–5 lines thick. In pastures, also in woods.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> 11×8µ <cite>W.G.S.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Almost as tall as L. procera, but slighter in stem and pileus; the

<p class='c017'><strong>L. Mor´gani</strong> Pk.—in honor of Professor Morgan. (Plate <a href='#plate014'>XIV</a>.)
<strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, soft, at first subglobose, then expanded or even depressed,
white, the brownish or yellowish cuticle breaking up into scales except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>on the disk. <strong>Gills</strong> close, lanceolate, remote, white, then green. <strong>Stem</strong>
firm, equal or tapering upward, subbulbous, smooth, webby-stuffed,
whitish, tinged with brown. <strong>Ring</strong> rather large, movable. <strong>Flesh</strong> both
of the pileus and stem white, changing to reddish and then to yellowish
when cut or bruised. <strong>Spores</strong> ovate or subelliptical, mostly uninucleate,
sordid green, 10–13×7–8µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Plant</strong> 6–8 in. high. <strong>Pileus</strong> 5–9 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 6–12 lines thick.

<p class='c000'>Open dry grassy places. Dayton, Ohio. <cite>A.P. Morgan.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>This species is remarkable because of the peculiar color of the spores.
No green-spored Agaric, so far as I am aware, has before been discovered,
and no one of the five series, in which the very numerous species
of the genus have been arranged, is characterized in such a way as to
receive this species.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems a little hasty to found a series (Viridispori) on the strength
of a single species. Until other species of such a supposed series shall
be discovered it seems best to regard this as an aberrant member of the
white-spored series. The same course has been taken with those Agarics
which have sordid or yellowish or lilac-tinted spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>It gives me great pleasure to dedicate this fine species to its discoverer
Mr. Morgan. <cite>Peck.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Commonly 6–8 in. high, 5–9 in. diameter, though larger specimens
are sometimes found. It is the most conspicuous Agaric in the meadows
and pastures of the Miami valley; it appears to flourish from spring to
autumn whenever there is abundance of rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is heavier and stouter than L. procera and I am disposed to claim
that it is the largest Agaric in the world. <strong>Spores</strong> 10–12×7–8µ. In
immature specimens they are greenish-yellow. <cite>Morgan.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>L. Morgani is one of the largest, handsomest of the genus. It is
very abundant in the western and southwestern states. Mr. H.I.
Miller, Terre Haute, Ind., writes August 18, 1898: “I have recently
measured several which were more than twelve inches across. At the
present time this mushroom is growing in more abundance throughout
Indiana than any other. It grows luxuriantly in the pastures, generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>in grand fairy rings, five, ten, fifteen feet in diameter. We find it also
in the woods. It is beautifully white and majestic, and these rings can
be seen in meadows where the grass has been eaten close, for half a
mile or more. The gills are white until the cap is almost opened, by
which time the green spores begin to cause the gills to change to green.
The meat is fine and is usually more free from worms than other mushrooms.
Six families, here, have eaten heartily of them. The experience
is that one or two members of each family are made sick, though
in two families, who have several times eaten them, no one was made
sick. I enjoy them immensely, and never feel any the worse for eating
them. I doubt if we have a finer-flavored fungus. The meat is simply
delicious. One fairy ring yields a bushel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Prof. W.S. Carter, University of Texas, Galveston, reported to me
(and sent specimens of L. Morganii) the poisoning of three laboring
men from eating this fungus. They were seriously sick, but recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conclusion is inevitable that this green-spored Lepiota contains a
poison which violently attacks some persons, yet is harmless upon others.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have not had opportunity to test it. It should be tested with great
caution.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. Frie´sii</strong> Lasch.—in honor of Fries. <strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, soft, lacerated
into appressed tomentose scales. <strong>Stem</strong> hollow, with a webby pith, subbulbous,
scaly. <strong>Ring</strong> superior, pendulous, equal. <strong>Gills</strong> subremote,
linear, crowded, branched. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy but rather thin, convex or nearly plane, clothed with a
soft, tawny or brownish-tawny down, which breaks up into appressed,
often subconfluent scales, the disk rough with small acute, erect scales.
<strong>Flesh</strong> soft, white. <strong>Gills</strong> narrow, crowded, free, white, some of them
forked. <strong>Stem</strong> equal or slightly tapering upward, subbulbous, hollow,
colored like the pileus below the ring, and there clothed with tomentose
fibrils which sometimes form floccose or tomentose scales, white and
powdered above. <strong>Ring</strong> well developed, flabby, white above, tawny
and floccose-scaly below. <strong>Spores</strong> 7–8×3–4µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Plant</strong> 2–5 in. high. <strong>Pileus</strong> 1–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 2–5 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Catskill mountains and East Worcester. July to September.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have quoted the description of this species as it is found in Epicrisis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>because the American plant which I have referred to it does not in
all respects agree with this description, but comes so near it that it can
scarcely be specifically distinct. In the American plant, so far as I
have seen it, erect, acute scales are always present, especially on the
disk, and the down of the pileus does not always break up into distinct
areas or scales. Neither is the stem usually scaly, but rather clothed
with soft tomentose or almost silky fibrils. The gills are crowded and
some of them are forked. At the furcations there are slight depressions
which interrupt the general level of the edges, and give them the appearance
of having been eaten by insects. The plant has a slight odor,
especially when cut or bruised. <cite>Peck</cite>, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Remarks under L. acutesquamosa apply to L. Friesii, which Fries
himself doubts being distinct from the first. The plants vary greatly in
size, color and habitat. The name—acutesquamosa—carries a descriptive
meaning with it that L. Friesii does not.</p>

<p class='c000'>It does not appear to have been reported except by Professor Peck,
but probably appears as L. acutesquamosa in other lists.</p>

<p class='c000'>The edible qualities are excellent.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. acutesquamo´sa</strong> Wein.—<em>acutus</em>, sharp; <em>squama</em>, a scale. <strong>Pileus</strong>
fleshy, obtuse, at first hairy-floccose, then bristly with erect, acute,
rough scales. <strong>Stem</strong> somewhat stuffed, stout, bulbous, powdered above
the moderate-sized ring. <strong>Gills</strong> approximate, lanceolate, simple. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> convex or nearly plane, obtuse or broadly subumbonate,
clothed with a soft tawny or brownish-tawny tomentum, which usually
breaks up into imperfect areas or squamæ, rough with erect, acute scales,
which are generally larger and more numerous on the disk. <strong>Gills</strong> close,
free, white or yellowish. <strong>Stem</strong> equal, hollow or stuffed with webby filaments,
subbulbous. <strong>Spores</strong> about 7×3–4µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods and conservatories. Buffalo, <cite>G.W. Clinton</cite>; Albany, <cite>A.F.
Chatfield</cite>; Adirondack mountains and Brewertown, <cite>Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The form found in the hot-houses seems to have the tomentum of the
pileus less dense and the erect scales more numerous than in the form
growing in woods. The annulus is frequently lacerated. In the specimens
of the woods the erect scales are sometimes blackish in color, and
they then contrast quite conspicuously with the tawny or brownish-tawny
tomentum beneath them. They vary in size and shape. Some
resemble pointed papillæ, others, being more elongated, are almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>spine-like.  These are sometimes curved. They are generally larger
and more numerous on the disk than elsewhere, and often they are
wholly wanting on the margin. <cite>Peck</cite>, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>West Philadelphia, 1897, on lawn and growing from trunk of a maple
tree; Mt. Gretna, Pa., mixed woods. <cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>I first saw specimens of L. acutesquamosa when sent to me by Miss
Lydia M. Patchen, President Westfield Toadstool Club. It was later
found by myself and tested. Specimens were sent to Professor Peck
and identified as L. acutesquamosa.</p>

<p class='c000'>Caps and stems brownish-purple. The pointed squamules or tufts
have dark-brown points, shaded to a delicate purple at base. Gills
light, faint flesh-color. Veil is silky, transparent, beautiful, quite tenacious—stretching
until cap is well expanded, persistent, though at times
fugacious. Smell like stewed mushrooms. The caps are of excellent
substance and flavor.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. his´pida</strong> Lasch.—rough. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2–3 in. across. <strong>Flesh</strong> thin,
white, unchangeable; hemispherical then expanded, umbonate, tomentose
or downy at first from the remains of the universal veil; during
expansion the down becomes broken up into small, spreading, scaly
points, which eventually disappear, umber-brown, sometimes with a
tawny tinge. <strong>Gills</strong> free but near to the stem, the collar of the pileus
prominent and sheathing the stem, crowded, ventricose, simple, white.
<strong>Stem</strong> about 3–5 in. long, 3–5 lines thick, attenuated upward, densely
squamosely-woolly up to the superior, membranaceous, reflexed ring,
dingy-brown, stem tubular, but fibrillosely stuffed. <strong>Spores</strong> 6–7×4µ
<cite>Massee</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In margins of and in open mixed woods, under pine trees, Haddonfield,
N.J., July to September, 1892. Quite plentiful year after year in
the same places. The American plant is taller than the English species,
the stem reaching five inches, and the color of the cap a delicate tawny-brown.
Smell slight, but pungent like radishes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole fungus is tender and delicious. It is one of the few Lepiotæ
that stews well.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. feli´na</strong> Pers.—belonging to a cat. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin, bell-shaped or
convex, subumbonate, adorned with numerous subtomentose or floccose
blackish-brown scales. <strong>Gills</strong> close, free, white. <strong>Stem</strong> slender, rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>long, equal or slightly tapering upward, hollow, clothed with soft, loose,
floccose filaments, brown. <strong>Ring</strong> slight, evanescent. <strong>Spores</strong> elliptical,
6–8×4–5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Plant</strong> 2–3.5 in. high. <strong>Pileus</strong> .5–1.5 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 1–2 lines
thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods. Adirondack Mountains. August and September.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is easily distinguished from A. rubrotincta by the darker color of
the scales of the pileus, by the loose floccose filaments that clothe the
brown stem, by the fugacious ring and the smaller spores. <cite>Peck</cite>, 35th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The caps compare favorably with other Lepiotæ in substance and
flavor.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. crista´ta</strong> A. and S.—<em>crista</em>, a tuft, crest. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin, bell-shaped
or convex, then nearly plane, obtuse, at first with an even reddish or
reddish-brown surface, then white adorned with reddish or reddish-brown
scales formed by the breaking up of the cuticle, the central part
or disk colored like the scales. <strong>Gills</strong> close, free, white. <strong>Stem</strong> slender,
hollow, equal, smooth or silky-fibrillose below the ring, whitish. <strong>Ring</strong>
small, white. <strong>Spores</strong> oblong or narrowly subelliptical, 5–7×3–4µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Plant</strong> 1–2 in. high. <strong>Pileus</strong> .5–1.5 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 1–2 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grassy places and borders of woods. June to September.</p>

<p class='c000'>This species is easily known by its small size and the crested appearance
of the white pileus, an appearance produced by the orbicular unruptured
portion of the cuticle that remains like a colored spot on the
disk. The fragments or scales are more close near this central part and
more distant from each other toward the margin, where they are often
wholly wanting. The scales are sometimes very small and almost granular.
In very wet weather the margin of the pileus in this and some
other species becomes upturned or reflexed. <cite>Peck</cite>, 35th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Found in Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia. June to September,
1897. <cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Scales were appressed and slightly tinged with brown, often very
small. Caps of same, upturned and bare near margin. Taste sweet,
slightly like new meal. Odor strong.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cooked it is of good consistency and pleasing to taste.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><strong>L. alluvi´na</strong> Pk.—<em>alluvies</em>, the over-flowing of a river. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin,
convex or plane, reflexed on the margin, white, adorned with minute
pale-yellow hairy or fibrillose scales. <strong>Gills</strong> thin, close, free, white or
yellowish. <strong>Stem</strong> slender, fibrillose, whitish or pallid, slightly thickened
at the base. <strong>Ring</strong> slight, subpersistent, often near the middle of the
stem. <strong>Spores</strong> elliptical, 6–7×4–5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Plant</strong> 1–2 in. high. <strong>Pileus</strong> .5–1 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 1–1.5 lines thick.
Alluvial soil, among weeds. Albany. July.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fresh plant the scales are of a pale yellow or lemon color, but
in drying they and the whole pileus take a deeper rich yellow hue. The
ring is generally remote from the pileus, sometimes even below the
middle of the stem. <cite>Peck</cite>, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1897, I found it growing among weeds on lot near University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Seemingly it is a city resident.</p>

<p class='c000'>The taste and smell are pleasant. Cooked it is tender and savory.
Both stems and caps are good.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. metulæ´spora</strong> B. and Br.—<em>metula</em>, an obelisk. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin, bell-shaped
or convex, subumbonate, at first with a uniform pallid or brownish
surface, which soon breaks up into small brownish scales, the margin
more or less striate, often appendiculate with fragments of the veil.
<strong>Gills</strong> close, free, white. <strong>Stem</strong> slender, equal or slightly tapering upward,
hollow, adorned with soft floccose scales or filaments, pallid.
<strong>Ring</strong> slight, evanescent. <strong>Spores</strong> long, subfusiform.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Plant</strong> 2–3.5 in. high. <strong>Pileus</strong> .5–1.5 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 1–2 lines
thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods. Adirondack mountains. August and September.</p>

<p class='c000'>This species occurs with us in the same localities as L. felina, which
it very much resembles in size, shape and general characters, differing
only in color, the striate margin of the pileus and the character of the
spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>The species has a wide range, having been found in Ceylon, England,
Alabama and Kentucky. <cite>Peck</cite>, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L. naucina</em> Fr. is the European species which has its American counterpart
in L. naucinoides Pk. The variations in the American species
are noted under L. naucinoides.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Amanita phalloides—in its white form—the poisonous white Amanita,
resembles L. naucina or L. naucinoides in some stages of its growth
and may be confounded with it, careful note should be taken of their external
differences. In L. naucinoides the bulb and stem are continuous,
each passing into the other imperceptibly; in A. phalloides the junction
of stem and bulb is abrupt and remains so, and the bulb is more
or less enwrapped in the volva. The ring is also larger than in L. naucinoides
and is pendulous, and the gills are permanently white. A certain
means of distinguishing between them is by the application of heat
as in cooking. On toasting both it will be found that the gills of the
Amanita <em>remain white</em>, but those of the Lepiota <em>turn quickly brown</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>L. naucinoides Pk. is the American counterpart of L. naucina Fr.,
a European species, excepting that the spores of the latter are described
as globose. The caps are ovate when young and usually from 1½-3 in.
across when expanded, but occasionally reach 4 in., smooth, but
frequently rough or minutely cracked in the center, white or varying
shades of white deepening in color at the summit. In a rare form var.
squamo´sa, large, thick scales occur which are caused by the breaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>up of the cap surface. When young the gills are white or faintly yellow,
becoming pinkish or dull brown in age. The pinkish hue is not always
apparent. The outer edge of the veil or ring is thickest; usually it is
firmly attached to the stem, but movable rings are frequently noticed.
When the plant ages the ring is often missing, but traces of it are always
discernible. Stem rarely equal, often it is distinctly bulbous, generally
tapering upward from a more or less enlarged base, hollow when fully
grown, until then containing cottony fibers within the cavity or appearing
solid, 2–3 in. long, ¼-½ in. thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its habitat is similar to that of the common mushroom—lawns,
pastures, grassy places—though unlike the latter it is found in woods.
Until thoroughly acquainted with it, specimens found in woods and
supposed to be L. naucinoides should not be eaten. An Amanita might
be mistaken for it. It is readily distinguishable from the common
mushroom and its allies by the color of the gills and spores which are
white, and differences in stem and veil.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is found from July until after hard frosts. It was first reported
edible by Professor Peck in 1875, under the name of Agaricus naucinus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The L. naucinoides is rewarding the favor with which it has been
received as an esculent, it being equal to the common mushroom and
quite free from insects. Large crops of it are reported from all over the
country, and from many sections it is told of as a stranger. During
1897–98 the author has found it in plenty upon ground familiar to him
for years, upon which it had not previously shown itself. The common
mushroom must look to its laurels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its cultivation as a marketable crop is possible and probable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whoever has seen the seed-stalks of an onion knows the shape from
which this fungus takes its name. The dense clusters are graceful,
dainty, and contain many individuals of all ages—from the very young
with egg-shaped heads, like pigmy C. comatus, to the fluff-capped eldest,
willowy and fair to look upon. The out-door kind soon droops
when matured; the young plants of a cluster will remain fresh for
several days after taken from their habitat. Stems in these tufts are
often quill-shaped, and the striations on the cap margins are shorter
than those on their indoor cousins. These grow in hot-houses and stables.
One of the two forms has a yellow cap, the other is white and
fair.</p>

<p class='c000'>These forms have often come to my table as a pleasant winter surprise.
Children in the hot-houses of Haddonfield, N.J., watched for
its appearance among the bedded plants, sure of a present when they
brought me a meal of it. Both the white and yellow varieties were
equally enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The entire fungus is tender and delicious cooked in any way.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. farino´sa</strong> Pk.—<em>farina</em>, meal. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin, rather tough, flexible,
at first globose or ovate, then bell-shaped or convex, covered with
a soft, dense, white veil of mealy down, which soon ruptures, forming
irregular, easily-detersible scales, more persistent and sometimes brownish
on the disk. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, unchangeable. <strong>Gills</strong> close, free, white,
minutely downy on the edge. <strong>Stem</strong> equal or slightly tapering upward,
somewhat thickened at the base, slightly mealy, often becoming glabrous,
hollow or with a cottony pith above, solid at the base, white,
pallid or straw-colored, the ring lacerated, somewhat appendiculate on
the margin of the pileus, evanescent. <strong>Spores</strong> subovate, 10–13×8µ.</p>

umbo and scales reddish or reddish-brown. <strong>Gills</strong> close, free, white.

<p class='c000'>The American lepiota belongs to the same genus as the parasol
mushroom and the Smooth lepiota. It has one character in which it
differs from all other species of Lepiota. The whole plant when fresh
is white, except the umbo and the scales of the cap, but in drying it
assumes a dull reddish or smoky-red color. By this character it is
easily recognized.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the very young plant the cap is somewhat egg-shaped and nearly
covered by the thin reddish-brown cuticle, but as the plant enlarges the
cuticle separates and forms the scales that adorn the cap. On the
central prominence or umbo, however, it usually remains entire. The
margin of the cap is thin and is generally marked with short radiating
lines or striations. The gills do not quite reach the stem and are, therefore,
free from it. Sometimes they are connected with each other at or
near their inner extremity by transverse branches. They are a little
broader near the margin of the cap than at their inner extremity. The
stem affords a peculiar feature. It is often enlarged towards the base
and then abruptly narrowed below the enlargement, as in the Onion-stemmed
lepiota. In some instances, however, the enlargement is not
contracted below and then the stem gradually tapers from the base upward.
The stem is hollow and usually furnished with a collar, but sometimes
this is thin and may disappear with advancing age. Wounds or
bruises are apt to assume brownish-red hues.</p>

<p class='c000'>The caps vary in width from 1–4 in.; the stems are from 3–5 in.
long, and 2–5 lines thick. Sometimes plants attain even larger
dimensions than these. The plants grow singly or in tufts in grassy
ground or on old stumps. They may be found from July to October.</p>

<p class='c000'>The A. mellea is unusually prolific and is common over the United

in middle latitudes it is common from August until after light frosts. It
is usually in tufts, some of which contain scores of plants and are showy
over ground filled with roots, or on stumps or boles of decaying trees.
It frequents dense woods and open clearings. I have seen acres of dense
woodland at Mt. Gretna, Pa., so covered with it and its varieties that
but few square yards were unoccupied.</p>

<p class='c000'>A description of the typical A. mellea will rarely apply to any one

include something of nearly every white-spored Agaric under the sun.
Yet there is something indescribable about it which once learned will
unerringly betray it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its <strong>Caps</strong> vary from perfectly smooth, through tufts of scales and hairs,
more or less dense, to matted woolliness. It may show any one of these
conditions in youth and be bald in age. Some shade of yellow is the
prevailing color, but this will vary from whitish to dark-purplish or
reddish-brown. When water-soaked it is one color, when dry, another.
Commonly the margins of the <strong>Caps</strong> are striated, sometimes they are
smooth as a cymbal, and not unlike one, have a raised place or umbo
in the center. <strong>Flesh</strong> white or whitish. <strong>Gills</strong> when young are white or
creamy, usually running down the stem, sometimes slightly notched at
attachment. They freckle in age and lose their fair complexion. The
<strong>Veil</strong> or collar about the stem is as variable as fashion—thick and closely
woven or flimsy as gossamer, or vanishing as the plant grows old. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span><strong>Stems</strong> may be even as a lead pencil, or swollen like a pen-holder, or
bulbous toward the base, or distorted by pressure in the tufts. It is as
variable in color as the cap, usually darkening downward in hues of
brown. The outside is firm and fibrous, sometimes furrowed, inside
soft or hollow.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Cap</strong> 1–6 in. across. <strong>Stem</strong> 1–6 in. long, ¼-¾ in. thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>obscu´ra</em> has the cap covered with numerous small blackish scales.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>fla´va</em> has the cap yellow or reddish-yellow, but in other respects
it is like the type.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>gla´bra</em> has the cap smooth, otherwise like the type.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>radica´ta</em> has a tapering, root-like prolongation of the stem,
which penetrates the earth deeply.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>bulbo´sa</em> has a distinctly bulbous base to the stem, and in this
respect is the reverse of var. radicata.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck writes: “Var. <em>exannulata</em> (Plate <a href='#plate016'>XVI</a>, fig. 2, p. 52)
has the cap smooth and even on the margin, and the stem tapering at
the base. The annulus is very slight and evanescent or wholly wanting.
The cap is usually about an inch broad, or a little more, and the plants
grow in clusters, which sometimes contain forty or fifty individuals. It
is more common farther south than it is in our state (N.Y.), and is
reported to be the most common form in Maryland. This I call var.
exannulata.” From <cite>Dr. Taylor</cite>, Washington, D.C.; Indiana, <cite>H.I.
Miller</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these may be added also var. <em>al´bida</em> Pk. in which the pileus is
white or whitish.</p>

<p class='c000'>A variety, perhaps a variation of var. bulbosa was sent to me by E.
B. Sterling, Trenton, N.J., and afterward found by myself at Mt.
Gretna, Pa. The <strong>Cap</strong> purplish-brown, convex, striate and light on
margin, edge irregular with parts of veil attached. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, very
thin. <strong>Gills</strong> decurrent, arcuate, pinkish-gray. <strong>Stem</strong> stuffed, fibrous, white
above, dense floccose veil, same color as cap below, swollen toward
base which is pointed, sulcate, white inside, closely clustered and some of
the stems distinctly bulbous. <strong>Taste</strong> decidedly unpleasant. An intense
acridity develops and increases when the juices of raw pieces are swallowed,
and the salivary glands are much excited. The acridity is not
lost in cooking. It simply can not be eaten. Specimens were sent by
me to Professor Peck who referred it to A. mellea.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have never seen the abortive form of Clitopilus abortivus, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>found in many places and in great quantity, showing any part or trace
of the original plant. But that a similar monstrosity occurs upon A.
mellea is shown by individuals and parts of individuals of a cluster being
aborted. Without such positive proof, no one would suspect either of
these odd formations to be abortive of either C. abortivus or A. mellea,
or any other fungus. I consider the abortive form of A. mellea far
superior in substance and flavor to it or any of its varieties.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Armillaria can not be ranked among the tender or high-flavored
toadstools, yet their abundance, meaty caps and nourishing qualities
place them among our most valuable food species.</p>

<p class='c000'>The caps when chopped into small pieces make good patties and
croquettes. They have an impressive flavor of their own, and offer an
esculent medium for seasoning and the gravies of various meats.</p>

applied by the ancients to several plants, especially <em>spica nardi</em>—spikenard.)
<strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, firm, thick and compact on the disk, thin toward
the margin, whitish, variegated with brown spots, with a thick, tough
and separable cuticle. <strong>Flesh</strong> white. <strong>Gills</strong> crowded, subventricose,
slightly emarginate, whitish. <strong>Stem</strong> solid, fibrous, not bulbous, sheathed
below by the brown velvety veil, the ring narrow, spreading, uneven on
the edge. <strong>Spores</strong> subglobose, 6µ in diameter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cuticle of caps when dry breaking up into brownish, squamulose
scales, margin involute. <strong>Gills</strong> subdecurrent. <strong>Veil</strong> thick, persistent.
<strong>Stem</strong> short, subbulbous, solid. <strong>Flesh</strong> white. Very much resembles a

<p class='c017'><strong>A. mu´cida</strong> Schrad.—<em>mucidus</em>, slimy. <strong>Pileus</strong> commonly shining
white, thin, almost transparent, hemispherical then expanded, obtuse,
more or less radiato-wrinkled, smeared over with a thick tenacious gluten;
margin striate when thinner. <strong>Stem</strong> 1½-3 in. long, 1–2 lines thick
at the apex, thickened at the base, stuffed, thin, rigid, curved ascending,
smooth, white, but sooty scaly at the base when most perfectly developed.
<strong>Ring</strong> inserted at the apex of the stem, bent downward and
glued close to the stem, furrowed, the white border again erect, with a
swollen and entire margin, which sometimes becomes dingy brown.
<strong>Gills</strong> rounded behind, obtuse, adhering to the stem and striato-decurrent,
distant, broad, lax, mucid, always shining white.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very variable in stature, from 1 in. (when of this size the stem is
almost equal) to as much as 6 in. broad. The color of the pileus varies
gray, fuliginous, olivaceous. The gills sometimes become yellow, but
only from disease. Sometimes solitary, sometimes a few are joined in
a cespitose manner at the base. <cite>Stevenson.</cite></p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> symmetrical, generally fleshy, never truly umbilicate, seldom
umbonate. <strong>Veil</strong> absent or appearing only as fibrils or down on the
margin of the pileus. <strong>Gills</strong> sinuate
(the small sudden curve near the
stem always apparent in the young
plant), sometimes with a slightly decurrent
tooth. <strong>Stem</strong> central, usually
stout, fleshy-fibrous, without a bark-like
skin. <strong>Flesh</strong> continuous with
that of the pileus. <strong>Ring</strong> and <strong>Volva</strong>
absent. <strong>Spores</strong> white or dingy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But one is known to be poisonous.
Some are acrid or unpleasant in flavor.
With one exception all grow
on the ground in pastures and woods,
appearing from May to late in the
autumn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gills generally white or dingy, frequently
spotted or stained. The pileus
may be smooth or adorned with
fibrous or downy scales, dry, moist,
viscid or water-soaked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distinguishing feature of Tricholoma is the sinuate gills.  In
Collybia the stem bears a distinct bark-like skin; in Clitocybe the gills
are never sinuate; species of Pleurotus are distinguished by growing on
wood only, and Paxillus by their strongly-incurved margin and anastomosing
gills.</p>

<p class='c000'>In cooking Tricholoma consistency must be the guide to plan and
time. The tougher varieties require to be cut into small pieces and to
be well cooked, while the brittle and delicate varieties will cook quickly.
Many of them make excellent soups.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fragrant tricholoma has a distinct farinaceous odor and flavor.
In other respects it closely resembles the Earth-colored tricholoma of
which it is considered a mere variety. The typical European plant is
said to be without odor or nearly so and has not been classed among
the edible species by European writers. But our variety, though not
high-flavored, is fairly good and entirely harmless. Its cap varies considerably
in color but is some shade of gray or brown. Its center is
without any prominence or very bluntly prominent, and its surface is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>commonly very obscurely marked with innate fibrils or in small plants
may have very small flocculose tufts or scales. The flesh is whitish as
also are the gills, though these sometimes assume a more decided grayish
hue. They are rather broad and loose and sometimes uneven on
the edge or even split transversely. They are usually deeply excavated
next the stem and attached to it by a narrow part. The stem is whitish
or slightly shaded with the color of the cap. It often has a few longitudinal
fibrils, but never any collar. It may be either solid, stuffed or
spongy within, or in large specimens, hollow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plants grow gregariously or sometimes in tufts on the ground
under or near trees or in thin woods, especially of pine, or in mixed
woods. The caps vary from 1–4 in. broad, and the stems from 1–3 in.
long and from 2–6 lines thick. The plants occur in autumn. In Europe
there is a variety of this species which also has a farinaceous odor, but
it differs from our plant in having reddish edges to the gills. It is called
variety orirubens. <cite>Peck</cite>, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. fragrans is plentiful and gregarious among New Jersey pines,
October to frost. Other varieties are often found. Specimens found
by me at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and sent to Professor Peck who identified

<p class='c000'>The species is variable in size and color. Stevenson remarks:
“Scarcely any species has been more confounded with others.” It may
always be safely distinguished by its odor, by its distant gills, by the
smooth cuticle of the cap cracking into scales, and by the change of
color to reddish when bruised.</p>

    <div><i>Gr.</i>—sloping. (From the depression of the pileus.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><strong>Pileus</strong> generally fleshy, becoming thin toward the margin, flexible or
tough, plane or depressed, margin involute. <strong>Gills</strong> adnate or decurrent,
never sinuate. <strong>Stem</strong> confluent and homogeneous with flesh of pileus,
somewhat elastic, with a spongy stuffing, frequently becoming hollow,
externally fibrous. Universal veil when present conspicuous on the
pileus like frost or silky dew, but commonly wanting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Growing on the ground, frequently in groups.  The thinner and
hygrophanous species appear late in autumn. Some are quite fragrant.
Collybia, Mycena and Omphalia are separated by their stems being cartilaginous,
not externally fibrous as in Clitocybe. Tricholoma by its
sinuate gills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Variations in species of Clitocybe are great. A few are easily fixed
in the genus, but many of them will puzzle the amateur and perplex
the expert. The gills are always attached to the stem, and usually run
down it. They are not notched next to the stem as in Tricholoma.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like Tricholoma, Clitocybe has many species, most of which are common,
and are probably edible. I therefore give Professor Peck’s description
of all Clitocybes thus far submitted to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I know of but one species which is injurious to some persons—Clitocybe
illudens. Many eat and enjoy it. It does not agree with others.
A few untried species are suspicious to a like extent. Clitocybe illudens
possesses the property of phosphorescence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several species of Clitocybe have not been seen or tested by me, nor
have I information that these have been tested.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. nebula´ris</strong> Batsch.—<em>nebula</em>, a cloud. (Plate <a href='#plate024'>XXIV</a>, fig. 7, p. 82.)
The Clouded clitocybe, Clitocybe nebularis, takes its name from the
clouded-gray appearance of its thick cap, which is at first convex, but
when mature, either flat or a little depressed. Its flesh is white, thickest
in the middle, and in a vertical section is seen to taper rapidly downward
into the stem. The gills are close together and rather narrow for
the size of the plant. They are white or yellowish-white. The stout
solid stem usually tapers upward from the base and is whitish.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cap is two to four inches or more broad, the stem one to two
inches long and about half an inch thick. The Clouded mushroom
grows in woods, and sometimes forms large tufts or clusters among fallen
leaves. It is found in autumn, but is not very common in this country.
Authors differ in their estimate of the edible qualities of this mushroom,
but the more recent ones generally agree in classing it as edible. “Mushrooms
and Their Use,” <cite>C.H. Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 2–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 1–2
in. long, 4–8 lines thick. Mossy ground in deep woods. North Elba.
September.</p>

<p class='c000'>This species is intermediate between C. nebularis and C. clavipes.
In its general appearance, and in the character of the pileus and stem,
it resembles C. nebularis, but in the character of the more distant gills
and in the size of the spores it is nearer C. clavipes, of which it might
perhaps be regarded as a variety. Two forms are distinguishable. In
one the gills are more distant, slightly rounded behind, and adnate or
abruptly terminated; in the other they are closer and more distinctly
decurrent. The plant is edible. <cite>Peck</cite>, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have known this fungus very favorably since 1883, and regard it as
one of the best. I have seen it in the West Virginia mountains only,
but it will probably be found in cool, shaded, high localities all over the
country. Both it and the C. nebularis are well worthy of search.</p>

concentrically rivulose. <strong>Gills</strong> close, adnate or decurrent, cinereous,
sometimes tinged with dingy-yellow. <strong>Stem</strong> short, solid, sometimes
compressed, grayish-brown, with a whitish tomentum at the base.
<strong>Spores</strong> subglobose or broadly elliptical, 5–6.5µ; flesh whitish-gray,
odor slight.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Plant</strong> gregarious, 1–2 in. high. <strong>Pileus</strong> 1–1.5 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong>

Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>A pale form of this species grows on sandy soil, in which the pileus
is smoky white, but it becomes grayish-brown in drying. The mycelium
binds together a mass of sand, so that when the plant is taken up
carefully a little ball of sandy soil adheres to the base of the stem. The
stem is sometimes pruinose. The flavor is mild and agreeable. <cite>Peck</cite>,
50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes plentiful about Philadelphia. Edible. Caps tender, slight
flavor.</p>

plane, thin, crowded, white. <strong>Stem</strong> 2–3 in. long, 3–4 lines thick,
equally attenuated upward from the base, glabrous, sooty, elastic,
stuffed. <strong>Spores</strong> elliptical, 7–8×4µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Damp places among mosses in pine woods, etc. Distinguished by
the blackish color of the almost flat pileus, and the very slightly decurrent

<p class='c017'><strong>C. cyanophæ´a</strong> Fr. <i>Gr.</i>—blue. <strong>Pileus</strong> 3–4 in. broad, becoming
bluish-dusky-brown, compact, convex then plane, obtuse, smooth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span><strong>Stem</strong> 3 in. long, 1 in. thick at the base, attenuated upward, robust,

<p class='c000'>New York, Albion. In woods. October. Edible. <cite>Dr. E.L.
Cushing.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Specimens sent to me by Dr. Cushing are the first and only ones of
the species I have seen. The description is accurate. The spores were
cream color.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. monadel´pha</strong> Morg.—<em>monas</em>, single; <em>adelphos</em>, a brother. From
its cespitose habit. (Plate <a href='#plate027'>XXVII</a>.) Densely cespitose. <strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy,
convex then depressed, at first glabrous, then scaly, honey color, varying
to pallid-brownish or reddish. <strong>Stem</strong> elongated, solid, crooked,
twisted, fibrous, tapering at the base, pallid-brownish or flesh color.
<strong>Gills</strong> short, decurrent, not crowded, pallid flesh color. <strong>Spores</strong> white,
a little irregular, 7.5×5.5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the ground in wet woods, spring to late autumn. <strong>Pileus</strong> 1–3 in.
<strong>Stem</strong> 3–7 in. <cite>Morgan.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Grassy places. Menands. Albany county. September. Edible.
Resembling Armillaria mellea, but distinguished from it by the absence
of a collar from the stem, by the more decidedly decurrent lamellæ and
by the solid stem. It is also more agreeable in flavor. It is related to
C. illudens in habit and manner of growth. <cite>Peck</cite>, 51st Rep. N.Y.

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> 8×5µ <cite>Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>October 15, 1898. Identified by Professor Peck. September until
frost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grows in great clusters about roots, etc., at Mt. Gretna. Frequently
much water-soaked and uninviting. Taste variable, sometimes strong,
woody.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is edible, but care should be exercised in collecting to get young,
fresh groups.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. socia´lis</strong> Fr.—<em>socius</em>, a companion. <strong>Pileus</strong> about 1 in. broad,
pale-yellowish with a reddish tinge, fleshy, convex then expanded,
acutely umbonate especially when young, even, smooth, dry. <strong>Flesh</strong>
moderately thin, white. <strong>Stem</strong> 1 in. long, 2 lines or a little more thick,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>solid, fibrous, commonly ascending, smooth, reddish, the rooting base
hairy. <strong>Gills</strong> plano-decurrent, scarcely crowded, becoming yellow. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>A very pretty species, densely gregarious, inodorous. The stem is
sheathed-hairy at the base like Marasmius peronatus. Its greatest affinity
is with A. vernicosus, of which it is perhaps a variety. <cite>Stevenson.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Quite common in pine woods of New Jersey. Though small, goodly
messes of it may be gathered from its patches. The caps make a pleasing

<p class='c000'>Readily distinguished by the strong, aniseed smell, dingy bluish-green
pileus, and the pallid or greenish gills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes somewhat cespitose. Tough; size variable, color varies

<p class='c000'>Edible. Exceedingly spicy. The flavor is pleasant, but rather
strong. A few specimens mixed with others of like texture but less
flavor make a tasty dish.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. rivulo´sa</strong> Pers.—<em>rivus</em>, a stream. (Named from rivulet-like streaks
on pileus.) <strong>Pileus</strong> 1–3 in. across, flesh thin, convex then plane and

<p class='c000'>Found at Devon, Pa., 1888; Angora, West Philadelphia, 1897. It is
equal to the Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) in texture, but not
so high in flavor. Well cooked it is an agreeable and valuable food.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. pithyoph´ila</strong> Secr. <i>Gr.</i>—pine-loving. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2–3 in. broad, dead-white
when moist, shining whitish when dry, fleshy but <em>thin</em>, rather
plane, <em>umbilicate</em>, at length irregularly shaped, repand and undulato-lobed,
even, <em>smooth, flaccid</em>, the margin slightly striate when old. <strong>Stem</strong>
<em>somewhat hollow</em>, rounded then compressed, equal, even, smooth, obsoletely

Carrollton. September. <cite>Peck</cite>, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edible. Its small size gives it minor importance, but a quantity of
it makes an excellent meal.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. can´dicans</strong> Pers.—<em>candico</em>, to be shining white. Entirely white.
<strong>Pileus</strong> about 1 in. across, flesh thin, convex then plane or slightly
depressed, umbilicate, regular or slightly excentric, even, with an
adpressed silkiness, shining, shining white when dry. <strong>Gills</strong> adnate
then slightly decurrent, crowded, very thin, narrow, straight. <strong>Stem</strong>
1–2 in. long, 1–2 lines thick, even, glabrous, cartilaginous, polished,
equal, hollow, base incurved, rooting, downy. <strong>Spores</strong> broadly elliptical
or subglobose, 5–6×4µ. <cite>Massee.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Among damp fallen leaves, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Entirely white, small, rather tough; approaching Omphalia in the
structure of the stem. The following form is described by Fries as
occurring in pine woods: Stem thin, flexuous, base glabrous; pileus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>plane, not umbilicate, naked (without silky down). Gills scarcely
decurrent.</p>

<p class='c000'>A remarkable form but scarcely to be separated as a species. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Quite common in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. The
caps are excellent when well cooked.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. dealba´ta</strong> Sow.—<em>dealbo</em>, to whitewash. <strong>Pileus</strong> about 1 in. or a
little more broad, white, <em>slightly fleshy, tough</em>, convex then plane and
at length revolute and undulated, always dry (not watery in rainy
weather), even, smooth, <em>somewhat shining</em>, but as if innately pruinose
under a lens. <strong>Flesh</strong> thin, arid, white. <strong>Stem</strong> 1 in. long, 2 lines thick,
<em>stuffed, wholly fibrous</em>, at length also tubed, equal, but often ascending,
whitish, mealy at the apex. <strong>Gills</strong> <em>adnate</em>, scarcely decurrent, thin,
<em>crowded</em>, white.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> sometimes orbicular, sometimes upturned and wavy. <em>Odor
weak, pleasant</em>, but not very remarkable. Most distinct from A. candicans
in the nature of the stem.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edible. Its top is <em>exceedingly like ivory</em>. Its charming flavor is exceeded
by very few other fungi. <cite>Stevenson.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Among leaves and grass. Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c000'>This charming fungus is common over the land. I have known it

soon plane or slightly depressed in the center, glabrous, white, the margin
at first involute or decurved, naked. <strong>Flesh</strong> white. <strong>Gills</strong> narrow,
close, decurrent, whitish. <strong>Stem</strong> stout, rather short, solid, glabrous,
equal or slightly tapering upward, often with a bulbous base, white.
<strong>Spores</strong> elliptical, 8×4–5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 3–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 1–2 in. long, 8–12 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods among fallen leaves. Catskill mountains. September to
November.</p>

<p class='c000'>This large and robust fungus is closely allied to C. candida Bres.,
from which it differs in the naked margin of the pileus, the absence of
any marked odor and especially in the more elliptical shape of its spores.
The same plant has been collected in Maryland by Mr. L.J. Atwater,
who considers it edible, having eaten it with satisfaction and safety.
<cite>Peck</cite>, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>This fungus is quite plentiful in Pennsylvania and in open oak woods
in New Jersey. Its size and sometimes gregarious growth give it a
permanent food value. Its texture is coarse, but when cooked it is
highly satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. gallina´cea</strong> Scop.—<em>gallina</em>, a hen. Application not apparent.
White; acrid. <strong>Pileus</strong> 1–1½ in. across, rather fleshy at the disk, margin
thin; convex then depressed, but not funnel-shaped, even, dry,
opaque. <strong>Gills</strong> slightly decurrent, narrow, crowded, thin. <strong>Stem</strong> about
1½ in. long, 2 lines thick, equal, even, solid. Among grass, moss, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Resembling C. dealbata in form, but smaller, opaque, dingy-white,

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 1–3 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 2–4 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Open places, grassy ground, etc. Albany and Sandlake. June and
October. This species forms dense tufts, often composed of many individuals.
In this respect it is related to such species as C. tumulosa,
C. aggregata and C. illudens. From the crowding together of many
individuals the pileus is often irregular. Sometimes the disk is brownish
and occasionally slightly silky. The gills are sometimes slightly
sinuate, thus indicating a relationship to the species of Tricholoma. The
taste, though mild, is somewhat oily and unpleasant. The plants appear
in wet, rainy weather, either early in the season or in autumn. Specimens
have been sent to me from Massachusetts by R.K. Macadam and
Professor Farlow, and from Pennsylvania by Dr. W. Herbst. <cite>Peck</cite>,
43d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>West Virginia, New Jersey, Mt. Gretna, Pa. In May, and in autumn
months. Very variable in size, color, shape of gills, texture and taste.
<cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>The early spring clusters are remarkable for their tenderness and
excellence. Clusters of hundreds of individuals grew abundantly at Mt.
Gretna in May, 1899. When the fungus was young the gills were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>sometimes adnate, almost free, often decurrent. The varying color of
oysters is well seen in C. multiceps.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edible. They should be well cooked. The addition of a little lemon
juice or sherry conceals a slight raw taste sometimes present.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> 4–5µ <cite>Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grows in clumps or large masses about stumps or decaying trees from
August to October. Its bright, deep yellow is attractive from a distance.
As many as fifty plants may form a cluster. Cap from 2–6 in., fleshy,
convex or expanded, often with a raised center directly over the stem;
flesh juicy and yellow; gills yellow, widely separated, running down
stem unequally; stem long, firm, solid, smooth, tapering toward base.
When cooked the taste is rather saponaceous. Strong stomachs can
retain a meal of them, but the fungus generally sickens the eater.
Many testings show it to contain a minor poison. It is not deadly, but
should not be eaten. Bull. No. 2, Phila. Myc. Center.</p>

Indiana, <cite>H.I. Miller</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mysterious property of phosphorescence is possessed by this
fungus. As heat is known to develop in masses of the fungus it is of
interest to know whether it is from the phosphorescence or a ferment.
Its radiance by night surpasses its splendor by day. Mr. H.I. Miller,
of Terre Haute, Ind., first drew the writer’s attention to this quality.
A large box of specimens sent by him retained their luminous quality
after three days of travel to such an extent that the print of a newspaper
could be read when held close to the mass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Miller writes: “There is something about this fungus which
generates heat. When I bring in a basketful of it, for the pleasure its
phosphorescence affords my friends, I find that after having been in the
basket for two or three hours, and while piled one bunch upon top of

<p class='c000'>Var. polius found growing in large quantities in Boston navy yard in

Macadam.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>This woods-growing Clitocybe has been many times found by me in
a hot-house in Haddonfield, N.J. Professor Peck confirmed my identification.
Either its spores or mycelium had evidently been carried
thither in the wood-earth used by florists. The hot-house crops appeared
in March, and continued until June.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of the plants showed an effort to comply with some condition
unusual to them, by producing gills upon the upper side of the
pileus. Those below were venose and crisped.</p>

<p class='c000'>This wild species had thus been brought into cultivation. The cultivated

<p class='c000'>Ground in woods. Croghan. September.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gills sometimes terminate rather abruptly and are not strongly
decurrent, hence it might easily be mistaken for a Tricholoma. The
margin of the pileus is sometimes marked with slight ridges as in Ag.
laterarius. The odor is weak but aromatic and agreeable. <cite>Peck</cite>, 26th

<p class='c000'>The pileus is always very dry because the surface absorbs moisture.
Odor weak, pleasant, almost that of A. infundibuliformis. On account
of its gigantic stature and color, it has often been interchanged with A.

<p class='c017'><strong>C. infundibulifor´mis</strong> Schaeff.—<em>infundibulum</em>, a funnel; <em>forma</em>, form.
(Plate <a href='#plate024'>XXIV</a>, fig. 11, p. 82.) The Funnel-form clitocybe, Clitocybe
infundibuliformis, is a neat and pretty species easily recognized by the
funnel shape of its mature cap and by its pale red color. When very
young the cap is slightly convex and often adorned with a slight umbo
in its center. As it matures the margin becomes elevated so that the
cap assumes a shape somewhat resembling that of a wine glass. The
margin is sometimes wavy. The flesh is thin and white. The gills are
close, thin, white or whitish and decurrent. The stem is smooth, colored
like or a little paler than the cap and mostly tapering from the
base upward.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cap is 2–3 in. broad, the stem 1½-3 in. long and ¼-½ in. thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>The funnel-shaped mushroom grows in woods or copses in summer
and autumn, especially in wet seasons. It is somewhat variable in color,
but is usually a pale-red, tinged with buff, and sometimes becoming
more pale with age. It delights to grow among fallen leaves, and often
there is an abundant white cottony mycelium at the base of the stem.
When it grows in clusters the caps are apt to be irregular because of
mutual pressure. “Mushrooms and Their Use.” <cite>Peck.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> 5–6×3–4µ <cite>B.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Very common and in plenty after rains, when large patches of it may
be found. I have usually found the light pinkish-buff color to abound,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>and the stem thinner than described by Prof. Peck. Size of cap from
1–3 in.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a good, reliable food species. The stem should be removed, and

<p class='c017'><strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, usually thin, <em>margin incurved</em> at first, not corrugated.
<strong>Stem</strong> different in substance from the pileus, but confluent with it; hollow,
with a cartilaginous bark, internally cartilaginous or soft, often

<p class='c000'>Growing on the ground, wood, leaves and decaying fungi.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Clitocybe and Tricholoma the substance of the stem and pileus is
alike; they differ in the character of the stem. Tricholoma has no
distinct bark-like coat, and in Clitocybe the stem is covered with minute
fibers. In Mycena as in Collybia the stem is different in substance
from the pileus, but is distinguished by the margin of the pileus being
straight. It is most closely allied to Marasmius, which is characterized
by its tough coriaceous substance, which when dried fully revives and
expands on being moistened. The line between them can not always
be closely drawn, and there are numerous species which it is difficult to
place with certainty in either genus. This does not apply to the fleshy
edible species of this genus as they are quite distinct from Marasmius.</p>

<p class='c000'>Peck’s 49th Report contains a monograph of the New York species
of Collybia, supplemented by one of those found in other states.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several common, prolific, long-season, delicious fungi occur in this
genus. They vary in size from “a small coin” to five inches across.
They grow in woods, on wood, on ground, on leaves, on lawns and
among moss and grass in shaded places. The writer has tested many
species raw, and eaten small quantities cooked, which are not herein
described for the reason that not enough of a species was found to test
to full extent. So far as is reported and as his experience goes, there is
not a poisonous species in Collybia. Many of them are strong in odor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Distinguished by the very broad and deeply emarginate gills, which
frequently slope up behind to near the cap then with a short turn downward
connect with the stem which is either stuffed or hollow, and by
the abundant, cord-like rooting mycelium. The gills are very broad.
Professor Peck says: “The species is quite variable. The pileus is
sometimes irregular and even eccentric, the thin margin may be slightly
striate, is often split and in wet weather may be upturned or revolute.
The lamellæ are sometimes ½ in. broad or more and transversely split.
They may be obscurely striated transversely and even veiny above with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>venose interspaces. Occasionally a slight anise-like odor is perceptible,
but in decay the plants have a very disagreeable odor and disgusting
appearance.” 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the West Virginia mountains C. fusipes is frequent. Caps in the
clusters rarely exceed 1½ in. across. They show an auburn or burgundy
shade of brown in their color. When young they are smooth
and appear to remain so unless rained upon or moistened, when they
crack more or less finely in drying. At first the connection of the gills
with the stem is peculiar—they join in a collar-like ring at the top of the
stem. As the cap expands the gills part more or less and separate
from the stem. The stem is markedly spindle-shaped, though variously
flattened by compression in dense clusters; the outside often splitting,
breaking and turning out from the stem.</p>

<p class='c000'>The caps, alone, are good, the stem being hard and refractory. The
caps are very fine, cooked in any way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The caps dry well, and are a pleasant addition to gravies, soups and
other dishes. They make a choice pickle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our American plant, common to the states, is rarely found attaining
such dimensions. Its usual size is from 1–2 in. across, more frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>at 1–1¼. It is generally found in clusters more or less dense. The
color varies from yellowish to a dark yellowish-brown. The center is
darker than the margin. The cap viscid when moist, often irregular
from crowding. Gills may be rounded or notched at their attachment
to the stem, whitish or yellowish. Stem usually hollow, 1–4 in. long,
1–3 lines thick, whitish when young becoming colored with the dense
brownish velvety hairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>It grows on stumps, roots in the ground, trunks and earth heavily
charged with wood matter. I have found it in every month of the year.
The heavier crop appears in September, October and November, and
lasts until long after heavy frosts. Then sporadic clusters spring up
wherever the winter sun gives them encouragement.</p>

<p class='c000'>It sometimes does considerable damage to the tree so unfortunate as
to be its host. It begins its growth upon some injured or decayed spot
and by continually insinuating itself under the surrounding bark it, by
its mycelium and growth, pries the bark away from the wood until the
tree is entirely denuded.</p>

tinge when moist, sometimes approaching bay-red. It fades in drying
and becomes almost white or grayish-white, but sometimes the center
remains more deeply colored than the margin. The stem is commonly

<p class='c000'>In this genus the species of the various sections are not always distinguished
by single sharply defined characteristics, so that it will sometimes
be necessary to pay attention to all the features. Species with a

the Lactipedes are slippery when moist, but not truly viscous.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Mycena is a large genus composed of small species. About sixty
members have been found in America. They are from ½ to 1 in.
across the cap, with thin stems and altogether delicate appearance. Yet
the flesh of most of them has a gummy consistency in the mouth, and
they shrink but little in stewing. Heretofore not any appear to have
been reported as edible, probably because the size of the species has not
attracted experimenters. While some have a strong odor and taste of
radishes, and one species is bitter, it is probable that all are edible.
The writer has eaten, raw and cooked, small quantities (all he has found)
of many species not here reported as edible, which will, when further
tested, be reported upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The substance and flavor of those here given is remarkably pleasant.
Their late coming, hardiness and abundance are commendable qualities.</p>

dry, the broad umbo darker (dingy-brown), slightly striate, and
at length furrowed or rimosely split at the margin (pale yellowish or
becoming brownish-tan). <strong>Stem</strong> 2½-3 in. long, firm, rigid, <em>smooth,

<p class='c000'>Inodorous, only at length nauseous. Very closely allied to M. galericulata,
in habit approaching nearest to M. cohærens. The stems are
pallid at the apex, but slightly tawny-bay-brown below, and glued together

bell-shaped then expanded, at length rather plane, somewhat obtuse,
more or less corrugated (unequal with elevated wrinkles), always dry,
not moist even in rainy weather, striate at the circumference. <strong>Stem</strong>
commonly short, remarkably cartilaginous, tubed, rigid, tough, straight,
at length compressed, even, smooth, pallid, with a short oblique hairy
root. <strong>Gills</strong> <em>arcuato-adnate</em>, with a decurrent tooth, united behind in a
collar, somewhat distant, connected by veins, broad, ventricose, white
then gray, edge sometimes quite entire, sometimes with saw-like teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Always inodorous. Formerly connected with M. galericulata. M.
rugosa is arid, very tough, more rarely cespitose, the pileus firm, somewhat
obtuse, wrinkled but without striæ, the gills arcuato-adnate with
a hooked tooth, <em>white then ash-color</em>. The genuine M. galericulata is
fasciculato-cespitose, somewhat fragile, the pileus thinner, at first conical

<p class='c000'>The tenacity frequently occurring in Mycena is well shown in this species.
The caps and stem cook tender, but it is better to discard the
stems, as the two do not become tender at the same time.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>M. galericula´ta</strong> Scop.—<em>galericulum</em>, a small peaked cap. (Plate
Plate <a href='#plate010'>X</a>, fig. 5, p. 28.) <strong>Pileus</strong> somewhat membranaceous, conical bell-shaped
then expanded, striate to the umbo, dry, smooth, becoming
brownish-livid or changeable in color. <strong>Stem</strong> rigid, <em>polished, even,
smooth</em>, with a spindle-shaped root at the base. <strong>Gills</strong> <em>adnate, decurrent
with a tooth</em>, connected by veins, whitish and flesh-colored.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very protean. Normally growing in bunches, the numerous stems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>(never sticky) glued together with soft hairy down at the base. But it
occurs also solitary, larger, pileus as much as 2 in. broad, wrinkled-striate.
The essential marks by which it is distinguished from A. rugosa
are these: <strong>Stem</strong> in general thinner, less tense and straight, often curved,
more fragile. <strong>Pileus</strong> membranaceous, conico bell-shaped, umbonate,
striate but not corrugated, moist in rainy weather. <strong>Gills</strong> adnate, with
a decurrent tooth, more crowded, <em>whitish then flesh-colored</em>. The color
both of the pileus (normally dingy-brownish then livid) and of the stem
(normally becoming livid-brownish) is much more changeable than that
of A. rugosa, becoming yellow, rust colored, etc. It is not so tough
and pliant as A. rugosa. Forms departing from the type are very numerous;
the most beautiful is var. <em>calopus</em> (<i>Gr.</i>, beautiful; <i>Gr.</i>, a foot)
with chestnut-colored stems, united in a spindle-shaped tail. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Common. Autumnal. Very variable. On trunks, fallen leaves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two well-marked varieties of this very variable species were observed
the past season. One grows on the ground among fallen leaves. It has
a dark brown pileus, close lamellæ and a very long stem, generally of a
delicate pink color toward the top. It might be called var. <em>longipes</em>.
The other grows under pine trees, has a broadly convex or expanded
grayish-brown pileus and a short stem. It might be called var. <em>expansus</em>.

<p class='c000'>“<em>M. alcalina</em> is closely allied to it (M. galericulata), but has a stronger
alkaline odor and a rather more fragile stem. In one of your specimens
I detect a slight incarnate tint to the gills, and this is pretty conclusive
evidence that it belongs to M. galericulata. Species of Mycena are not
generally reckoned among edible fungi or even promising fungi; I suppose
on account of the thin flesh of the cap, but of course it is possible
to make up in numbers what is lacking in size. I am glad to know you
have found this to be an esculent one.” Letter Professor Peck to C.
McIlvaine, October 5, 1893.</p>

<p class='c000'>The caps and stems when young make as good a dish as one cares to
eat. The substance is pleasant, and the flavor delicate. They are best
stewed slowly in their own fluids, after washing, for ten minutes and

and straight but not very rigid, thickened and bearded-rooted at the
base, pale below, dark violaceous above, when young white-mealy,
otherwise even, smooth, dry. <strong>Gills</strong> simply adnate, ascending, somewhat
distant, rarely connected by veins, quite entire, white, somewhat

<p class='c017'><strong>O. campanel´la</strong> Batsch.—<em>campana</em>, a bell. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin, rather tough,
hemispherical or convex, glabrous, umbilicate, hygrophanous, rusty
yellow-color and striatulate when moist, paler when dry. <strong>Gills</strong> moderately
close, arcuate, decurrent, yellowish, the interspaces venose. <strong>Stem</strong>

<p class='c000'>The quantity alone, in which this small species can be found, makes
it worth mentioning as an edible species. It is common over the United
States where coniferous trees abound. Its favorite habitat is upon the
rotting debris of these trees. Occasionally it grows from the ground,
but only from that which is heavily charged with woody material. It
is social in troops, or affectionate in clusters, or maintains a single existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is edible, of good substance when stewed, tender and of fair flavor.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any odium attaches to the word toadstool, it should be forgotten
and forever banished in presence of this cleanly, neat, handsome genus,
choice in its growing places from lichen-covered stumps, or bark-clad
boles, or highly perched limbs, or the scented surfaces of decaying
wood. Several of its species perfume themselves throughout with pleasant
spicy odors. Many are most accommodating in their constant
coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. H.I. Miller, superintendent Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railroad,
writes: “Most of the mushroom books give greatest space to the
A. campester. For some parts of the country this may be desirable,
but for Indiana and Ohio, considering the food value, the P. ostreatus
is the best fungus we have in these states, from the fact that anybody
wanting a mess can nearly always obtain a basketful of this variety,
whereas the others depend upon a good many weather conditions.
Having located a few logs and stumps in the spring, where the P. ostreatus
grows, these same stumps and logs can be used all season. The
crops are successive, and while some of the spots seem to be barren for
a few days at a time, the others will be bearing. It does not make
much difference what the kind of log or stump, whether it be beech,
oak or elm, or what the species of tree. I think I have found them on
all our forest trees, and it is not necessary for the tree to be dead. If
there is a decaying portion, the spores seem to be carried by the little
black beetle that infests the ostreatus, from one place to another, and
wherever a small spot of dead wood is found we are likely to find the P.
ostreatus. This being the only edible mushroom that we can find in
large quantities all through the season in this neck of the woods, it
seems to me that a general knowledge of it will serve the economic purpose
more than any other fungi.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The presence of the P. ostreatus and its esculent companions is noted
from our northern boundary to the gulf. Poplar, maple, birch, hickory,
ash, apple, laburnum and oak trees are its favored residences.
Deer feed upon it, and kine are attracted by its scent even when deep
under snow. When properly selected and <em>slowly</em> cooked, the Pleuroti
are toothsome.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the fact that the spores of this fleshy and valuable genus find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>fostering lodgment in many trees when in decay, it is more than probable
that the several species can be propagated by planting their spores
upon such decaying woods, or by transplanting the mycelium.</p>

<p class='c000'>Growths of P. ostreatus, P. sapidus, P. salignus, and probably other
species of Pleurotus, can be forced, by watering the spots upon which
they are known to grow. Dr. Kalchbrenner mentions that the P.
sapidus is in this way cultivated in Hungary. Acting upon this mention
the writer had good success with P. ostreatus. Experiments in
this direction are likely to be interesting and rewarding.</p>

<p class='c000'>No species is suspected of being noxious.</p>

<p class='c000'>An analysis of P. ostreatus is given by Lafayette B. Mendel, Sheffield
Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Yale University, as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>The gills are sometimes torn across like those of Lentinus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The historic elms of Boston Common have borne copious crops of
this well-known and easily distinguished species from time immemorial.
Every fall, about the first of September, if the season is favorable, later
if not, copious crops appear decorating the trunks, and branches, sometimes
at a height of thirty or forty feet. Growth takes place where
branches have broken off or the trees have been wounded from other
causes. They occur very generally on elms in the outlying districts of
the city, but are rare in the country, seeming to be distinctly urban in
their tastes. No damage is apparent from their growth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Immediately in the rear of Independence Hall, Philadelphia, a fine
cluster appears with equal autumnal regularity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the elm tree is the chosen habitat of this fungus, it is little
less select in its choice than other members of its genus.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>When young and small P. ulmarius is tender and of acceptable flavor.

<p class='c017'><strong>P. tessula´tus</strong> Bull.—<em>tessela</em>, a small cube for pavement. <strong>Pileus</strong>
<em>becoming pale-tawny</em>, horizontal, compactly fleshy, convex then plane,
and in a form which is somewhat lateral depressed behind, irregular,
even, smooth, <em>variegated</em> with round and hexagonal paler <em>spots</em>. <strong>Flesh</strong>
thick, white. <strong>Stem</strong> short, 1 in. or little more long, solid, <em>compact</em>,
<em>equal</em> or attenuated at the base, very excentric, curved-ascending, even,
<em>smooth</em>, white. <strong>Gills</strong> <em>sinuate behind</em>, uncinato-adnate, thin, <em>crowded</em>,
white or becoming yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Solitary; according to some cespitose. The pileus is not cracked in
a tessellated manner, as one might easily imagine from the name, but
variegated with spots. Smaller than A. ulmarius (to which it is too
closely allied), but almost more compact, with a smell of new meal.</p>

<strong>Flesh</strong> thick, soft, variegated; convex then more or less flattened, irregularly
circular, obtuse, wrinkled, smooth, with a gelatinous cuticle,
rufescent. <strong>Stem</strong> excentric or almost lateral, but the pileus is always
marginate behind, fibrillose, short, equal, flesh fibrous, soft. <strong>Gills</strong> adnate,
3–4 lines broad, crowded, joined behind, dingy. <cite>Massee.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>On old trunks, squared timber, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very remarkable for having the flesh variegated as in Fistulina hepatica.

<p class='c000'>I frequently found this species in North Carolina, growing from oak
ties and standing oak timber. I did not notice distillation of rufescent
drops from the cap. The soft flesh had good flavor. The gelatinous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>cuticle imparts its character to the dish. Mixed with Lentinus lepideus,
a much tougher plant, which grows in great abundance in the same localities,
it makes toothsome food.</p>

always <em>thin</em>, unequal, curved, curved or flexuous, tough and flexile,
whitish, everywhere pruinato-villous, rooting and somewhat tomentose

<p class='c000'>Not observed in England until 1887.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quite common throughout the United States, growing upon decaying
wood, whether above or under ground. It has few distinct features.
The only positive one distinguishing it from P. ostreatus is its lilac-tinted
spores. The tint is faint but noticeable upon white background.
Excepting for purposes of the student, its separation, as a species, from
P. ostreatus is not necessary. When old it has more body than the
latter, but is equally superior as a food fungus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck remarks of it: “A stew made of it is a very good
substitute for an oyster stew.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It can be cultivated by watering the places upon which it is known to
appear.</p>

when old, fleshy, <em>soft, shell-shaped</em>, somewhat dimidiate, <em>ascending</em>,
smooth, moist, even, but sometimes with the cuticle torn into squamules.

light yellow, <em>and without glandules</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the most part cespitose, imbricated, very variable, sometimes

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>glandulo´sus</em> Ag. g. Bull.—With the habit of the typical form,
but larger. Pileus dark brown, becoming pale. Gills white, with scattered
small wart-like or glandular bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'>On trunks. A very constant but somewhat rare variety; easily known
by the dark-brown pileus. The gland-like bodies on the gills are due
to the outward growth of the hyphæ of the trama in minute patches
here and there. <cite>Massee.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>euos´mus</em> Berk.—strong-smelling. Strong scented, imbricate.
Pileus fleshy, depressed, shining, silky when dry, at first white with a

ventricose, dingy, white. <strong>Spores</strong> 12–14×5µ, pale pinkish-lilac.</p>

<p class='c000'>On elm trunks. Pilei very much crowded, 2 in. or more across,
deeply depressed, unequal, at first white, invested with a slight blue
varnish, at length of a pale brown. Stems distinct above, connate below.
Gills rather broad; running down to the bottom of the free portion
of the stem. Spores oblong, narrow, oblique, white, tinged with
purple. The whole plant smells, when first gathered, strongly of tarragon.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., <cite>McIlvaine</cite>; Haddonfield, N.J., <cite>T.J. Collins</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This esculent fungus closely allied to P. ostreatus, and differing only
in having lilac spores, has been followed from book to book by a bad
reputation, probably because of its “rosy” or lilac spores—all fungi
having pink spores having been, until recently, ignorantly branded by
authors as poisonous. The writer has eaten meals of it many times, as
have his friends. It is in every way equal to P. ostreatus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rare qualities of this species are stated in the descriptive heading
of the genus. Its very name implies excellence. The camel is gratefully
called the ship of the desert; the oyster mushroom is the shellfish
of the forest. When the tender parts are dipped in egg, rolled in
bread crumbs, and fried as an oyster they are not excelled by any vegetable,
and are worthy of place in the daintiest menu.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>P. salig´nus</strong> Schwam.—<em>salix</em>, willow. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2–3 in. broad, sooty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>ash-color or ochraceous, fleshy, compact, <em>spongy</em>, somewhat dimidiate,
<em>horizontal</em>, at first pulvinate, even, at length depressed behind and here
and there strigose, the incurved margin entire. <strong>Stem</strong> always short,
firm, more or less tomentose. <strong>Gills</strong> horizontal, hence less manifestly
decurrent, separate behind, but <em>branched in the middle</em>, crowded, dingy,
often eroded at the edge, not glandular.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the larger and firmer species. Solitary, scarcely ever cespitose.
It is commonly confounded with A. ostreatus, but is certainly a
different species. Although the stature is in general the same, it is
easily distinguished by the pileus being more compact, and more pulverulent
when young, then depressed, by the gills being thinner, more
crowded, somewhat branched, but not anastomosing behind, and dingy
soot-color; the spores also are dingy. <cite>Stevenson.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> oblong or cylindrical-oblong, 8×4µ <cite>W.G.S.</cite>; 8–10×3–4µ <cite>B.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Curtis wrote of this: “Indeed I have found several persons who
class this among the most palatable species. To such persons a dish
of fresh mushrooms need seldom be wanting, as this one can be had
every month of the year in this latitude.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In New Jersey, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, Pa., I have found P.
salignus in quantity. It has been sent to me by Dr. J.R. Weist, of
Richmond, Ind., who writes, “I have eaten it with great enjoyment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1881 I found it frequently on water beeches and willows, and thoroughly
tested its edible qualities. <cite>R.K. Macadam</cite>, Boston.</p>

<p class='c000'>When young or fresh, it is quite equal to any Pleurotus. When old,
as with others of the Pleuroti, it is tough. Nevertheless their margins
are always edible unless decaying.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ground. Sandlake. June. Edible.</p>

<p class='c000'>It grows singly or in tufts and is an inch or more in height. The
margin is thin and sometimes striatulate and reflexed. Toward the

tough and separable. The flesh is said by Gillet to be tender and
delicate. Persoon describes the disk as spongy-squamulose, but in our
specimens it is merely pubescent or tomentose. <cite>Peck</cite>, 39th Rep. N.Y.

<p class='c000'>Recorded as edible by Professor Peck. At Eagle’s Mere, Pa., I
found many specimens agreeing with this description. They grew from

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>The species is not noticeably viscid after its youth. The viscidity

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> regular or undulated and wavy, often viscid or moist. <strong>Flesh</strong>
of the pileus continuous with that of
the stem and descending as a trama
into the gills. <strong>Gills</strong> adnate or adnexed,
more or less decurrent, <cite>waxy</cite>,
often thick and forked, <cite>edge always
thin and sharp</cite>, often branched.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the ground. Many species are
brightly colored. <strong>Spores</strong> white.</p>

<p class='c000'>This genus differs from the preceding
genera in the manifest trama,
the substance of which is similar to
that of the pileus; from Lactarius
and Russula by the trama not being vesicular, but somewhat floccose
with granules intermixed; from Cantharellus, its nearest ally, by the
sharp edge of the gills. The Cortinarii, Paxilli and Gomphidii are at
once distinguished from it by their colored spores and the changing color
of their gills, as well as by other marks. From all the other genera of
Agaricini it is distinguished by a mark peculiar to itself, viz., by the
hymeneal stratum of the gills changing into a waxy mass, which is at
length removable from the trama. This altogether singular character is
specially remarkable in H. caprinus, coccineus, murinaceus, etc. Hence
the gills seem full of watery juice, but they do not become milky like
those of the Lactarii. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>From the description by Fries, the author of the genus, it is manifest
that one has to wait the ripening of the fungus before the peculiar characteristic
mark of the genus, <i>i. e.</i>—gills turning into a waxy mass,
easily removable from the cap—can be observed. Many of the species
are difficult to determine when fresh. Nevertheless, there is an indescribable,
watery, waxy, translucent appearance about the gills which
catches the eye of the expert, and is soon learned by the novice. The
white spores readily separate the genus from kindred shapes in the colored-spored
genera.</p>

<p class='c000'>So far as tested none of the species is poisonous. One English species
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>is fetid. It is probable that they are all edible, varying in quality
only. Fries well, and is superior in croquettes and patties.</p>

The stem also is white or but slightly shaded toward the base with the
color of the cap. It is variable in length and shape, being long or short,
straight or crooked, everywhere equal in thickness or tapering toward
the base. It is glutinous and unpleasant to handle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cap is 1–4 in. broad, the stem 2–4 in. long, and 4–8 lines thick.
The plants grow either singly or in tufts. In the latter case the caps
are often irregular from mutual pressure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plants occur early in October and November, in pine woods or
woods of pine and hemlock intermixed.</p>

color, fragile. <strong>Stem</strong> 3 in. long, ½-1 in. thick, solid when young, at
length hollow, very stout (not compressed), ventricose (attenuated at
both ends), striate, and for the most part squamulose at the apex, when
dry light yellowish or of the same color as the pileus, always white and

The hymenophore continuous with the stem. <strong>Pileus</strong>
somewhat rigid, fleshy, becoming more or less depressed,
often marked with concentric zones. <strong>Gills</strong>
unequal, membranaceous-waxy, slightly rigid,
milky, edge acute, decurrent or adnate and often
branched. <strong>Stem</strong> stout, central, rarely excentric
except in those growing on trunks. <strong>Spores</strong> globose, minutely echinulate,
white, rarely yellowish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly all grow on the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>Distinguished from all other fungi by the presence of a granular milk
which pervades every part of the plant and especially the gills; it is
commonly white, sometimes changing color and in section Dapetes
highly colored from the first. The nature of the milk, especially its
taste, whether acrid, subacrid or mild, must be carefully noted in distinguishing
species, as it is the most useful characteristic.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Russula, the only allied genus, the milk-bearing cells are present,
but their contents do not appear as milk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the species are peppery, acrid, astringent; some mildly so,
others will be long remembered if tasted raw. Yet not a species is hotter
than some radishes, onions, and others of our favorite vegetables.
Who would condemn them because they are peppery? There is not a
single species of Lactarius which retains its pepperiness after cooking.
This quality has to be and is supplied by one of our favorite condiments—pepper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>itself. Simply because they are <em>toadstools</em> and <em>hot</em>, they have
been condemned without trial. It is remarkable that not one of the
fungi known to be deadly gives any warning by appearance or flavor of
the presence of a poison. The day will probably come when it can be
said that if toadstool eaters will confine themselves to <em>hot</em> species, otherwise
attractive, they will run no risk. Panus stypticus is astringent,
not hot.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. plum´beus</strong> Fr.—like <em>plumbum</em>, lead. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2—5 in. broad, compact,
convex, then infundibuliform, dry, unpolished <em>sooty or brownish-black</em>.

<p class='c000'>The specimens which I have referred to this species were found in the
Catskill mountains several years ago, growing in hemlock woods, under
spruce and balsam trees. I have not met with the species since. The
pileus in the larger specimens had a minutely tomentose appearance,
but in the dried specimens this has disappeared. They also varied in
color from blackish-brown to pinkish-brown and grayish-brown, but
they can scarcely be more than a mere form or variety of the species
the description of which, as given by Fries, I have quoted. In the
Handbook the pileus is described as dark fuliginous-gray or brown, and
Gillet describes it as black-brown, dark fuliginous or lead color, and
adds that the plant is poisonous and the milk very acrid and burning.
Cordier says that the flesh is white and the taste bitter and disagreeable.

<p class='c000'>L. piperatus is a readily distinguished species. It is very common.
In 1881, after an extensive forest fire in the West Virginia forests, I saw
miles of the blackened district made white by a growth of this fungus.
It was the phenomenal growth which first attracted my attention to
toadstools. I collected it then in quantity and used it, with good results,
as a fertilizer on impoverished ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been eaten for many years in most countries, yet a few writers
continue to warn against it. It is the representative fungus of its class—meaty,
coarse, fair flavor. It is edible and is good food when one is
hungry and can not get better. It is best used as an absorbent of
gravies.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. decepti´vus</strong> Pk.—deceiving. <strong>Pileus</strong> 3–5 in. broad, compact, at
first convex and umbilicate, then expanded and centrally depressed or
subinfundibuliform, <em>obsoletely tomentose or glabrous</em> except on the margin,
white or whitish, often varied with yellowish or sordid stains, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>margin at first involute and <em>clothed with a dense, soft or cottony tomentum</em>,
then spreading or elevated and more or less fibrillose. <strong>Gills</strong> rather
broad, distant or subdistant, adnate or decurrent, some of them forked,
whitish, becoming cream-colored. <strong>Stem</strong> 1–3 in. long, 8–18 lines thick,
equal or narrowed downward, solid, pruinose-pubescent, white. <strong>Spores</strong>
white, 9–12.7µ. <strong>Milk</strong> white, taste acrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods and open places, especially under hemlock trees. Common.
July to September.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trial of its edible qualities was made without any evil consequences.

<p class='c000'>In common with all peppery Lactarii the present species loses the
quality in cooking. The edible qualities then depend upon texture,

<p class='c000'>L. involutus is readily mistaken for small forms of L. vellereus and

<strong>Gills</strong> somewhat decurrent, crowded, narrow, arcuate, often branched,

decurrent, narrow, saffron-color. <strong>Milk</strong> saffron-red or orange changing
to green; sweet scented but slightly acrid. I have never seen but one

grows in patches, sometimes in clusters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edible. <cite>Curtis.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>There is no question of its edibility. Old and modern writers applaud
it. Each cooks to his liking and thinks his own way best. It requires
forty minutes' stewing or baking; less time if roasted or fried. It can
be cooked in any way, but, like all Lactarii, it must be well cooked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exceptional color of L. indigo will halt anyone with ordinary
observing power. It is unnecessary to describe it further. Being a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>large, stout plant it frequently lifts the leaf mat as it pushes upward,
making leaf-mounds under which it is hidden, as do many of the Cortinarii.
But even in such instances there are usually a few solitary

<p class='c000'>It is edible, but coarse. Good flavor.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>L. chelido´nium</strong> Pk. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2–3 in. broad, at first convex, then
nearly plane and umbilicate or centrally depressed, <em>grayish-yellow or

<p class='c000'>The milk of this species resembles in color the juice of celandine,
Chelidonium majus. It is paler than that of L. deliciosus. By this
character and by the dull color of the pileus, the narrow lamellæ, short
stem and its fondness for dry situations, it may be separated from the
other species. Wounds of the flesh are at first stained with the color
of the milk, then with blue, finally with green. A saffron-color is sometimes
attributed to the milk of L. deliciosus, which may indicate that
this species has been confused with that, or that the relationship of the
two plants is a closer one than we have assigned to them. <cite>Peck</cite>, 38th

<p class='c000'>The relationship of this plant is with L. serifluus, to which it was
formerly referred, but from which I am now satisfied it is distinct. The
hollow stem is a constant character in our plant, and affords a ready
mark of distinction. The plant, though large, is very fragile, and
breaks easily. The taste is mild or but slightly acrid. Sometimes there
is an obscure zonation on the pileus, which, in large specimens, is apt
to be irregular and much worm-eaten. The milk looks like little drops
of water when first issuing from a wound, but it becomes a little less
clear on exposure to the atmosphere. The decided but agreeable odor
of the dried specimens persists a long time. <cite>Peck</cite>, 28th Rep.</p>

<p class='c000'>This plant is sometimes cespitose. The pileus when dry is tawny-gray
and scaly or cracked scaly. The margin may be even or coarsely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>sulcate-striate. The flesh is grayish or reddish-gray. The color of the
lamellæ varies from creamy-white to tawny-yellow. The stem often has
a conspicuous white myceloid tomentum at its base. I have never
found this plant with a white or milky juice, and therefore I am disposed
to regard it not as a variety of L. helvus, but as a distinct species.
Its mild taste and agreeable odor suggested a trial of its edible qualities.

<p class='c000'>This species is related to Lactarius volemus and L. hygrophoroides,
but its smaller size and short stem will distinguish it from the former
and its close gills from the latter. Its paler buff-color will separate it
from both. Some specimens have a narrow encircling furrow or depressed
zone near the margin and a slightly darker shade of color on
the margin. The milk constitutes a remarkable feature of the species.
According to the notes of the collector it is exceedingly copious, rather
sticky, serous in character with white particles in suspension. It flows
from many points as soon as the plant is disturbed and it stains the gills.
It is impossible to collect an unstained specimen, so free is the flow of
the milk. He, Mr. Webster, says: “I have never succeeded in picking
a specimen so quietly as to prevent an instant and copious flow of
its milk.” Torrey Bull., Vol. 23, No. 10, 1896.</p>

and pulverulent, and the gills luteous. It is also represented as a
small plant; but our specimens, while not fully agreeing with this description,
approach so closely to it in some of their forms that they
doubtless belong to the same species. We have therefore extended the
description so that it may include our plant. In wet weather the pileus

Very common.</p>

<p class='c000'>This species grows in almost every variety of soil and locality. It
may be found in showery weather on dry, rocky soil, on bare ground
or among mosses or fallen leaves. In drier weather it is still plentiful
in swamps and wet, shaded places, and in sphagnous marshes. It sometimes
grows on decaying wood. It is also as variable as it is common.
Gillet has described the following varieties:</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>cinnamo´meus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> cinnamon-red, sub-shining. <strong>Stem</strong> stuffed,
then hollow; taste mild, becoming slightly acrid or bitter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>ru´fus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> dull chestnut-red; becoming more concave.
<strong>Stem</strong> spongy; taste mild.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>ba´dius</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> bay-red, shining as if varnished, with an obtuse
disk and an inflexed, elegantly crenulate margin. <strong>Stem</strong> very glabrous,
hollow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first and second varieties have occurred within our limits. The
first also has the stem elastic and furnished with a whitish or grayish
tomentum or strigose villosity at the base, when growing among moss
in swamps. A form occurred in Sandlake, in which some of the specimens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>were proliferous. The umbo had developed into a minute pileus.
With us the prevailing color of the pileus is yellowish-red or cinnamon-red.
Sometimes the color is almost the same as that of L. volemus
and L. hygrophoroides, and again it is a tan-color or a bay-red, as in
L. camphoratus, from which such specimens are scarcely separable, except
by their lack of odor. In young plants the pileus usually has a
moist appearance, which is sometimes retained in maturity. Cordier
pronounces the species edible, and says that he has tested it several
times without inconvenience. <cite>Peck</cite>, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> regular, rigid, usually becoming more or less depressed.
<strong>Flesh</strong> of the pileus descending into
the gills forming a cellular trama.
<strong>Veil</strong> and consequently the ring absent.
Stem smooth, stout, rigid,
brittle, spongy within. <strong>Gills</strong> rigid,
fragile, edge thin and acute. <strong>Spores</strong>
rounded, often echinulate, white or
yellowish. On the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>Closely allied to Lactarius but
separated by the absence of milk.
The gills of some species exude watery
drops in moist weather. Owing
to the similarity of form and the variable
coloring many species are difficult
to determine; all the characters should be carefully noted, not
omitting that of the taste.</p>

<p class='c000'>Russulæ are readily distinguished by the stout, short, brittle stem and
the fragility of the pileus and gills. They especially love open woods
and appear during the summer and fall months, some being found until
sharp frosts occur.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been claimed by mushroom growers, until within a few years,
that the spores of the mushroom have to pass through the digestive
apparatus of the horse before they will germinate. It has been conclusively
demonstrated that such a transmission is not a necessity. It was
for a long time my opinion—following the opinion of others—that such
assistance was necessary. In my many efforts to propagate valuable
food species of the wild toadstools I endeavored to find the method by
which the spores were disseminated, and through what digestive medium
they passed—either of insect or animal—before germination. Noticing
that the Russulæ were fed upon by a small black beetle, I planted in
suitable places, not the toadstools, but the beetles found upon them.
The result was that in several instances I grew the Russulæ. My
experiments, while interesting, are not conclusive, because I later found
that the same results could be obtained from the toadstool itself when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>planted under its own natural life conditions. It is certain that beetles
can not be raised by planting Russulæ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The beetles known as tumble-bugs—canthon lævis—deposit eggs in
the center of balls made of animal droppings; dig a hole in the ground
and drop them into it. These droppings frequently contain the spores
of the meadow mushroom. Thus planted with the proper surrounding
of manure, and at the proper depth, the spores germinate, spread
mycelium, and a crop of mushrooms is the result. The beetle becomes
a horticulturist. No wonder the Egyptians, thousands of years ago,
made it—the scarabeus—their sacred emblem, and that, today, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fleur-de-lis</em></span> of France, so the Rosicrucians say, perpetuates its glorious
worth and calling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most Russulæ are sweet and nutty to the taste; some are as hot as
the fiercest of cayenne, but this they lose upon cooking. To this genus
authors have done especial injustice; there is not a single species among
them known to be poisonous, and, where they are not too strong of
cherry bark and other highly flavored substances, they are all edible;
most of them are favorites. Where they present no objectionable appearance
or taste, their caps make most palatable dishes when stewed,
baked, roasted or escalloped. The time of cooking should be determined
by the consistency of the variety; some will cook in five minutes,
others not under thirty. Salt, butter and pepper are the only necessaries
as seasoning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sandy soil in pine woods. Quogue. September.</p>

<p class='c000'>This species is related to Russula delica, but is easily distinguished
by its short stem and crowded gills. The pileus also is not shining and
the taste is tardily somewhat acrid. From Lactarius exsuccus it is
separated by the character of the gills and the very short stem which is
about as broad as it is long. The spores also are larger than in that
species. The gills in the young plant are sometimes studded with
drops of water. They are not clearly decurrent. Some of them are
forked at the base. The pileus is but slightly raised above the surface
of the ground and is generally soiled by adhering dirt and often marked
by rusty or brownish stains. The plants grew in old roads in the woods
where the soil had been trodden and compacted. <cite>Peck</cite>, 43d Rep. N.Y.

<p class='c017'><strong>R. ochrophyl´la</strong> Pk.—<em>ochra</em>, a yellow earth; <em>phyllon</em>, a leaf. <strong>Pileus</strong>
2–4 in. broad, firm, convex becoming nearly plane or slightly depressed
in the center, even or rarely very slightly striate on the margin when
old, purple or dark purplish red. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, purplish under the adnate
cuticle, taste mild. <strong>Gills</strong> entire, a few of them forked at the base,
subdistant, adnate, at first yellowish, becoming bright ochraceous buff
when mature, dusted by the spores, the interspaces somewhat venose.
<strong>Stem</strong> equal or nearly so, solid or spongy within, reddish or rosy tinted,
paler than the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> bright ochraceous buff, globose-verruculose,
10µ broad.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ochery-gilled Russula is a large fine species, but not a common
one. It differs but little in color and size from the European pungent
Russula, Russula drimeia, but it is easily distinguished from it by its
mild taste.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cap is dry, convex or a little depressed in the center, purple or
purplish red, the white flesh purplish under the cuticle, which, however,
is not easily separable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gills are nearly all entire, extending from the stem to the margin
of the cap. They are therefore much closer together near the stem than
at the margin. They are at first yellowish, but a bright ochraceous buff
when mature. They are then dusted by the similarly colored spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stem is stout, nearly cylindric, firm but spongy in the center and
colored like the cap, but generally a little paler. There is a variety in
which the stem is white and the cap deep red. In other respects it is
like the typical form. Its name is Russula ochrophylla albipes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ochery-gilled Russula grows in groups under trees, especially
oak trees, and should be sought in July and August. <cite>Peck</cite>, 51st Rep.

<p class='c000'><strong>Cap</strong> round when young, very hard, then convex or becoming dished,
sometimes repand. It is without a separable skin, covered with various
sized areas of mouldy looking patches which are at times distinctly
cracked. The color varies from a bright bluish-green to grayish-green,
such shades remind one of mouldy cheese or the shades of Roquefort;
again the color may vary in shades of light leather brown, occasionally
the caps are almost white, opaque in each shade of color. Flesh crisp,
brittle, thick, white, mild, good raw. Gills and stem as described.</p>

<p class='c000'>R. virescens is common in the United States but not generally plentiful.
It is a solitary grower, usually but few are found in a patch.
Striking in appearance when its green colors are present, and always
clean looking and inviting. It sometimes attains the size of 5 in. across.
It is a hot weather Russula and rarely appears before the latter part of
June, then after rains.</p>

<p class='c000'>To eat, it should be in a healthy, fresh condition. All Russulæ
impart a stale flavor if any part of gills or cap is wilting, drying or
decaying. It requires forty minutes' slow stewing, or it can be dressed
raw as a salad. Roasted or fried crisp in a hot buttered pan it is at its
best. It should be well salted.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>R. lep´ida</strong> Fr.—<em>lepidus</em>, neat, elegant. <strong>Pileus</strong> 3 in. broad, <em>blood-red-rose</em>,
becoming pale, whitish especially at the disk, somewhat equally

<em>with a silky appearance, at length often cracked scaly</em>, margin
spreading, obtuse, without striæ. <strong>Stem</strong> as much as 3 in. long, often
1 in. thick, <em>even, white or rose-color</em>. <strong>Gills</strong> rounded behind, rather
thick, somewhat crowded, often forked, connected by veins, white, often
red at the edge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taste mild; wholly compact and firm, but the flesh is cheesy, not
somewhat clotted. The gills are often red at the edge, chiefly toward
the margin, on account of the margin of the pileus being continuous
with the gills. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>The crisp flesh of R. lepida requires forty minutes' slow stewing, if
stewed. It yields a delicate pink shade to the dish. Roasted or cooked

<p class='c000'>R. Linnæi is one of our handsomest and best Russulæ. European
authors state its habit to be exactly that of R. emetica, but though I have
known it intimately for many years I have not been struck with this in
the American plant. Its large size, its more or less red stem never entirely
white, at times hollow, cavernous, its less solid flesh, habit of growing
in troops, sometimes parts of rings, flourishing best where the leaf
mat is heaviest, loving the leaf drift in fence-corners, are well marked
distinctions.</p>

it. Preferred to others in Indiana and Illinois. <cite>H.I. Miller</cite>, 1898.</p>

<p class='c000'>The varying reports upon R. emetica are quoted above. In 1881, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the West Virginia mountains, I began testing this Russula and soon
found that it was harmless. At least twenty persons ate it in quantity,
during its season, for four years. Yet, in my many published articles, I
continued, out of regard for the opinions of others and in excess of
caution, to warn against all bitter and peppery fungi. But from that
time until the present I have eaten it, and I have made special effort to
establish its innocence by getting numbers of my friendly helpers to eat it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was suggested by one of its prosecutors that perhaps I was mistaking
another fungus for it. In October, 1898, I sent to Professor
Peck a lot of the Russula I was eating. He wrote: “It seems to be
R. emetica as you state. It certainly is hot enough for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The change in color of the cap which gives name to this species is
not remarkable. Most species of Russulæ are sensitive to light. An
otherwise highly colored cap will be almost white when a leaf adheres
to it. If in youth it grows under dense shade it will be very much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>lighter than if where light is generous, and will remain so. If in growing
it thrusts itself out of shadow, its color will change and it will
deepen. The apparent rarity of R. chamæleontina I think due to the
close observation necessary to detect its changes in color, which, as I
have found it, are by no means constant. It is quite plentiful in the
pines of southern New Jersey, and at Mt. Gretna, Pa., it is frequently
found.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Cantharellus the gills—vein-like and generally
thick with an obtuse edge—are entirely
different from those of all the preceding
genera. In those they are thin, and distinct
from the pileus and from each other. In
Hygrophorus the gills are frequently thick,
but the edge is always sharp. The species
of Craterellus are funnel-shaped, resembling some of those in Cantharellus,
but are distinguished by their lack of evident gills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Monograph New York Species of Cantharellus, <cite>Peck</cite>, Bull. 1887.</p>

<p class='c000'>The members of this genus are few, but they are choice. Of them
is the Cantharellus cibarius, of which Trattinik quaintly says: “Not
only this same fungus never did any one harm, but might even restore
the dead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer first made its acquaintance when among the West Virginia
mountains in 1881. The golden patches of single and clustered
cibarius, fragrant as ripened apricots, tufting the short grass or mossy
ground under beeches, oaks and like-growing trees, through which the
sunlight filtered generously, were so tempting, that he determined there
must be luxury, even in death, from such toadstools.</p>

<p class='c000'>Experiments made by the writer in West Virginia where the species
grows luxuriantly and is of much higher flavor than any he has found
elsewhere, prove that it is easy to transplant within congenial habitats,
either by the mycelium or spores. Nature, there, resorts to washing
masses of leaves containing the propagating parts of the fungus along
the depressions of the water-sheds, and it is found growing plentifully
where the wind has drifted forest leaves against trees, brush, and fence-corners.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that locality there is a marked difference between C. brevipes and
C. floccosus. The latter is much longer, and markedly resembles the
large end of a gold lined cornet. Like the C. cibarius it is not of as
good quality in eastern states.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck reports over forty species of this genus found in New
York state. Several not found in New York are reported from other
states. The writer has found a few such species in Pennsylvania and
West Virginia. Many untried species will probably prove to be edible;
the majority are too small to be of food value. M. urens, reported poisonous,
and M. peronatus, heretofore considered poisonous, have been
found by the writer to be edible. Several species not described herein
have been tested for edibility to a limited extent only.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this genus occurs the famed M. oreades, the Mousseron of France,
the Champignon and Scotch bonnet of England, the Fairy-ring mushroom

<p class='c000'>M. peronatus is the wood-cousin of M. oreades. It is still reputed
poisonous by all writers upon the subject, though M.C. Cooke gives it
the benefit of a doubt. The name is given because of the base of the
stem being densely covered with short hairs or a woolly down, and is
thus easily recognized. It is common in woods, among decaying
leaves, especially of the oak, from May until after frosts. It is usually
solitary, but a few individuals are sometimes clustered. It is quite
peppery to the taste, but pleasantly so. I have repeatedly eaten it,
as have my friends. It loses its acridity in cooking, and though the
caps are tougher than M. oreades, they make a highly flavored and
delicious dish. Collectors should carefully test it for themselves.</p>

where the rings are to be found M. oreades can be gathered when
shriveled, and are quite as good, after soaking, as when fresh.</p>

<p class='c000'>M. oreades must be sought for where the grass is luxuriant. It hides
among it. It is well worthy of the search. Raw, fresh or shriveled,
it is sweet, nutty, succulent when eaten; stewed well it is delicious.
Though tough its consistency is agreeable. The most delicate stomachs
can digest it. The writer saved the life of a lovely woman by feeding
her upon it when nothing else could be retained; and of another, by
feeding Coprinus micaceus, after a dangerous operation. He introduced
these species, together with a few others, into a large hospital in Philadelphia,
where they were used with marked beneficial effect, and such
use is now widespread.</p>

<p class='c000'>When dried, by exposure to the air or sun, it can be kept indefinitely,
neither losing its aroma or flavor, which it graciously imparts to soups

<p class='c000'>“The genera Lentinus and Lenzites
are found in every region of the
world; their principal center, however,
is in hot countries, where they
attain a splendid development. On
the contrary, toward the north they rapidly decrease in number.”
Fungi. <cite>Cooke and Berkeley.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>In habitat and mode of growth Lentinus closely resembles Pleurotus,
and parallel genera with colored spores. When young the species are
inviting, and when well cooked are meal-giving. They are not delicacies,
but substantials. They dry well. Grated they make soups, and
give their pleasant flavor to any dish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck writes to me: “This plant, by reason of its rather
tough substance, has commonly been referred to Lentinus, under the
name L. Lecomtei Schw., but this reference is scarcely satisfactory to
me, since the edge of the lamellæ is scarcely at all serrate as required
by that genus. It seems to me it would go better under the genus
Panus. It is variable—sometimes eccentric or even lateral. It is sometimes
called Lentinus strigosus, but I do not think the two are distinct
species, however distinct they may be in form.” February 26, 1894.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like all Lentinus the present species is rather tough, yet chopped
into small pieces, well cooked and seasoned, it is quite equal to P.
ostreatus and many others of high renown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lentinus lepideus is a sort of commercial traveler. It is common
wherever railroads are. It is partial to oak ties and its mycelium is injurious
to them. It is found upon pine and other timbers. The writer
has collected large clusters of it from oak sawdust. The European
plant is noted as “almost always solitary.” In the United States it is
seldom so. It is noted as growing in damp, dark places, but it loves
the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a food it is about on a par with P. ulmarius, not as tough, but
harder when old. It is a reliable species from spring until late autumn,
is persistent and dries well. It is neat, handsome, prolific. When
young it makes a good dish, and when old can be used to advantage in
soups.</p>

<strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, at first campanulate, then convex or expanded, <em>even,
glabrous, generally becoming fibrillose or slightly floccose-villose</em> on the
disk, occasionally cracked, variable in color. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> broad, somewhat
ventricose, at first whitish, then flesh-colored. <strong>Stem</strong> equal or
slightly tapering upward, firm, solid, fibrillose or subglabrous, variable
in color. <strong>Spores</strong> broadly elliptical, 6.5–8×5–6.5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span><strong>Plant</strong> 2–6 in. high. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 3–6 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>The typical form has the pileus and stem of a dingy or brown color
and adorned with blackish fibrils, but specimens occur with the pileus
white, yellowish, cinereous, grayish-brown or blackish-brown. I have
never seen it of a true cervine color. It is sometimes quite glabrous
and smooth to the touch and in wet weather it is even slightly viscid.
It also occurs somewhat floccose-villose on the disk, and the disk,
though usually plane or obtuse, is occasionally slightly prominent or
subumbonate. The form with the surface of the pileus longitudinally
rimose or chinky is probably due to meteorological conditions. The
gills, though at first crowded, become more lax with the expansion of
the pileus. They are generally a little broader toward the marginal
than toward the inner extremity. Their tendency to deliquesce is often
shown by their wetting the paper on which the pileus has been placed
for the purpose of catching the spores. The stem is usually somewhat
fibrous and striated but forms occur in which it is even and glabrous.
When growing from the sides of stumps and prostrate trunks it is apt to
be curved. Two forms deserve varietal distinction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>al´bus</em>. Pileus and stem white or whitish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>al´bipes</em>. Pileus cinereous yellowish or brown. Stem white or
whitish, destitute of blackish fibrils.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Europe there are three or four forms which have been designated
as species under the names of A. rigens, A. patricius, A. eximius and
A. petasatus, but Fries gives them as varieties or subspecies of A. cervinus,
though admitting that they are easily distinguished. None of
these have occurred in our state. <cite>Peck</cite>, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>visco´sus</em>. The normal character of the cuticle of the species is
slightly viscid in wet weather, but the specimens we collected and photographed
were exceedingly viscid. They also differed from the normal
form in their lighter color, flesh much thicker at the disk and thin at the
margins, and cuticle not appearing fibrillose. It is close to petasatus,
but differs, however, in its narrower gills and in having no striæ. It is
a good variety if it is not a good species. <cite>Lloyd</cite>, Myc. Notes.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> 7–8×5–6µ <cite>K.</cite>; 6–8×4–5µ <cite>B.</cite>; 4×5µ <cite>W.G.S.</cite>; 5.8×4.6µ <cite>Morgan</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frequent on decaying stumps, roots and wood, May to frost. <cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Its free gills should distinguish it from any Entoloma, though both
have pink spores and eventually pink gills. Among the earliest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>large species. The sight of it is stimulating to the mycophagist. He
then knows the toadstool season to be truly opened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Caps only are tender. The stems are edible, but they are not of the
same consistency as the caps, therefore will not cook with them. Fried
in a buttered pan or broiled, they are exceedingly toothsome.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, 1898, a beautiful variety (see Plate <a href='#plate061'>LXI</a>, fig. 2, p.—),
occurred which I had not previously seen. It was sent by me to Professor
Peck. The plants grew in large clusters from rotting, refuse
straw in the ruin of a stable; the white, cottony mycelium running
upon and through the straw. The solid stems of some were straight,
others curved, ranging from 2–6 in. long, the taller ones tapering from
base to spindling apex, the shorter ones decidedly bulbous and ending
abruptly. They were twisted and delicately marked. These markings
break up into dark thread-like fibrils, leaving the stem striate and satin-glossy.
<strong>Pileus</strong> from 2–4 in. across, dark Vandyke-brown when young,
lighter in age, streaked, glossy. <strong>Gills</strong> at first white, tardily changing
to light salmon color, broad, ventricose, free.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taste and smell pleasant of almonds. Good, delicious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck wrote of it: “It has the general appearance of
Pluteus cervinus, but these specimens seem to depart from the usual
form of growing in clusters from the ground, and in having an almond
flavor. Without knowing more about it I would scarcely feel justified
in separating it from such a variable species. As Fries sometimes remarks
concerning variable species: Perhaps several species are concealed
under the one name, but a pretty full and accurate knowledge of
them is desirable if one is to split them up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This is excellent judgment. While I believe the above to be a distinct
species, the disposition to make new species of varieties is regrettable
in many botanists.</p>

<p class='c000'>The species is closely related to P. cervinus and P. umbrosus, but is
readily distinguished from them by the peculiar vesture of the pileus
and stem. The granules are so minute and so close that they form a
sort of plush on the pileus, more dense on the disk and radiating
wrinkles than elsewhere. The clothing of the stem is finer, and has a
velvety-pubescent appearance, but in some instances it breaks up into
small scales or squamules. The color of the pileus and stem is usually
some shade of yellow or brown, but occasionally a grayish hue predominates.
The darker color of the granules imparts a dingy or smoky
tinge to the general color. The disk is often darker than the rest of
the pileus. <cite>Peck</cite>, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

suspicious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even the reported poisonous species have a pleasant odor corresponding
to those of the esculent species. This makes them the more deceptive
and dangerous. The pinkish or flesh-colored spores and gills
distinguish Entoloma from Hebeloma, which has brown spores, and
Tricholoma, which has white. Pluteus, which has pink spores and gills,
is readily separated from it.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> more or less excentric or regular, margin at first involute.
<strong>Gills</strong> more or less decurrent, never
sinuate nor seceding from the stem,
salmon-color. <strong>Stem</strong> fleshy or fibrous,
not polished and cartilaginous externally,
central, expanded upward into
the flesh of the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong>
smooth or warted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Closely resembling Eccilia, differing
mostly in the stem not being
cartilaginous at the surface. Distinguished
from Entoloma by the gills
not being sinuate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Agrees in structure with Clitocybe
in the Leucosporæ. <cite>Massee.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Growing on the ground, often strong smelling. Caps usually depressed
or umbilicate and waved on margin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the best of edible kinds are within this genus; a few are unpleasant
raw, none poisonous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most authors follow Fries in the arrangement of the species, dividing
them into two groups, the Orcelli, distinguished by deeply decurrent
gills and an irregular, scarcely hygrophanous pileus, with the margin at
first flocculose; and Sericelli, distinguished by adnate or slightly decurrent
gills and a regular silky or hygrophanous-silky pileus with a
naked margin. This arrangement is not strictly applicable to some of
our species. C. abortivus, C. erythrosporus and C. Noveaboracensis
have the gills deeply decurrent in some individuals, adnate or slightly
decurrent in others, and therefore the same species might be sought in
both groups. For this reason the primary grouping of our species has
been made to depend upon the variation in the spore colors. By far
the greater number of our species appear to be peculiar to this country,
only two of them occurring also in Europe.</p>

white, taste and odor farinaceous. <strong>Gills</strong>
deeply decurrent, <em>close</em>, whitish then
flesh-colored. <strong>Stem</strong> short, solid, flocculose,
often eccentric, thickened above,
white. <strong>Spores</strong> elliptical, 9–10×5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Generally a little smaller than the
preceding species, softer and more irregular,
but so closely allied that by some
it is considered a mere variety of it. It
is said to be edible and of delicate flavor.
It occurs in wet weather in pastures and
open places. <cite>Peck</cite>, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grows in oak woods, Angora, West Philadelphia; Mt. Gretna, Pa.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pastures. Saratoga county.</p>

<p class='c000'>The species is related to C. prunulus from which it is distinct by its
shorter, paler spores, its glabrous pileus cracked in areas on the disk
and tinged with red or yellowish and by its paler gills. From C. pseudo-orcella
it differs in its glabrous pileus with no silky luster and in its
closer gills. Its odor is obsolete but it has a farinaceous flavor. It is
probably esculent, but has not been found in sufficient quantity to afford
a test of qualities. <cite>Peck</cite>, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. unitinct´us</strong> Pk.—one-colored. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin, <em>submembranaceous</em>,

<strong>Flesh</strong> whitish or grayish-white, odor obsolete, taste mild.
<strong>Gills</strong> narrow, moderately close, <em>adnate or slightly decurrent</em>, colored like
the pileus. <strong>Stem</strong> slender, straight or flexuous, subtenacious, equal,
slightly pruinose, grayish-brown, with a close white myceloid tomentum
at the base and white root-like fibers of mycelium permeating the soil.

<p class='c000'>It requires longer cooking than C. prunulus, and is then quite equal
in excellence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fungus is so named because of the abortive form of it frequently

<p class='c000'>The plant is gregarious or cespitose. Sometimes, especially in the
variety, it grows in lines or arcs of circles. The margin is often undulated,
and in the variety it is, when fresh and moist, clothed with a film
of interwoven webby white fibrils which give it a peculiar appearance,
and if the spore characters are neglected it might be mistaken for Clitocybe
phyllophila. The disk is often tinged with reddish-yellow or rusty
hues when moist, and its rivulose character is then more distinct. A
farinaceous odor is generally present, especially in the broken or bruised
plant, but its taste is bitter and unpleasant. Sometimes bruises of the
fresh plant manifest a tendency to assume a smoky-brown or blackish
color. The base of the stem is sometimes clothed with a white mycelioid
tomentum. <cite>Peck</cite>, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

but Professor Fries limited it to species
with pink spores. In this sense
we have taken it. The spores in
some species are even, in others
rough or angulated. The stem is
either entirely wanting or is very
short and inconspicuous, a character
indicated by the generic name. The
pileus often rests upon its back and
is attached by a point when young,
but it becomes turned backward with age. The species are few and infrequent.
All inhabit decaying wood.</p>

attached by the pileus or rarely narrowed behind into a short stem-like
base, caps often overlapping one another, suborbicular or kidney-shaped,
<em>downy</em>, somewhat pointed-hairy or scaly-hairy toward the margin, <em>yellow

<p class='c000'>Decaying wood. Sandlake. Catskill and Adirondack mountains.
Autumn.</p>

<p class='c000'>This fungus was placed by Fries among the Pleuroti, and in this he
has been followed by most authors. But the spores have a delicate
pink color closely resembling that of the young lamellæ of the common
mushroom, Agaricus campestris. We have, therefore, placed it among
the Claudopodes, where Fries himself has suggested it should be placed
if removed at all from Pleurotus. Our plant has sometimes been referred
to Panus dorsalis Bosc., but with the description of that species it does
not well agree. The tawny-color, spoon-shaped pileus, pale floccose
scales, short lateral stem and decurrent lamellæ ascribed to that species
are not well shown by our plant. The substance of the pileus, though
rather tenacious and persistent, can scarcely be called leathery. The
flesh is white or pale yellow. The hairy down of the pileus is often
matted in small tufts and intermingled with coarse hairs, especially
toward the margin. This gives a scaly or pointed-hairy appearance.
The color of the pileus is often paler toward the base than it is on the
margin. <cite>Peck</cite>, 39th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The light yellow tomentosity of the cap arranges itself into shapes as
fascinating as crystals of snow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taste pleasant, mild. Texture more solid than P. ostreatus, consequently
tougher. It is edible but not desirable. Must be chopped
fine and cooked well.

<p class='c026'>Ochrosporæ, third in color series, ranges in spore color from dull
ochraceous, through bright ocher, to rusty orange and ferruginous or
iron-rust. The various shades will tax even a color expert.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are no species in the series corresponding to Amanitæ. In
Acetabularia there is a cup-like volva; in Pholiota there is a distinct
interwoven ring on the stem; in Cortinarius the secondary veil is like a
cobweb, and may form an imperfect zone around the stem, or hang as
fibers from the margin of the cap; Pluteolus exactly resembles Pluteus.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many edible species of good quality in the series. None
are known to be poisonous. The substance, as a rule, is tougher than
in most of the preceding genera, and in many instances has a strong
woody flavor. Several species are late growers, and are among the best
of fungi. Notably in Pholiota.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stevenson notes in his description of the genus: “None are to be
commended as edible.” My investigation shows that there are several
delicious species, notably P. squarrosa and subsquarrosa. Their lateness
and plentifulness make them valuable food fungi. I have nothing
but praise for the entire genus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Early Pholiota is a small but
variable species. From other similarly
colored species that appear in grassy
ground early in the season, the collar on
the stem will generally distinguish it.
Its cap is usually convex when young
but nearly flat in the mature plant. It
is rather pale in color but not a clear white, being tinted with yellow or
pale tan-colored hues. The gills are whitish when the cap first opens,
but they soon change to a rusty-brown hue in consequence of the ripening
of the spores. They are excavated at the inner extremity and
slightly attached to the stem. They are ventricose when the cap is
fully expanded. The stem is rather slender, nearly or quite straight
and soon smooth and hollow. It is pale or whitish, and usually furnished
with a small collar. Sometimes the collar is slight and disappears with
age and sometimes the fragments of the veil remain attached to the
margin of the cap leaving nothing for a collar.</p>

very viscid or glutinous when moist,
scaly, yellow. <strong>Flesh</strong> whitish. <strong>Gills</strong>
close, adnate, yellowish becoming
rust-color with age. <strong>Stem</strong> equal or
slightly thickened at the base, scaly
below the slight radiating floccose
ring, solid or stuffed, yellow, generally
rust-color at the base. <strong>Spores</strong>
elliptical, 7.6×5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fat pholiota is a showy species.
Its tufted mode of growth,
rather large size, yellow color and
rusty-brown scales make it a noticeable
object. The stem is somewhat
and the cap very viscid when moist,
and this viscidity when dry gives it a shining appearance. The scales
of the cap become erect or reflexed and sometimes appear blackish at
the tips. They sometimes disappear with age. The flesh is firm and
white or whitish. The gills when young are yellow or pale-yellow, but
when mature they assume a ferruginous or rusty color like that of the
spores. The stem is similar in color to the cap, but paler or nearly
white at the top and usually reddish-brown or rusty-brown at the base.
The collar is slight and often scarcely noticeable in mature specimens.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <strong>Cap</strong> is 2–4 in. broad, the <strong>Stem</strong> 2–4 in. long and 4–6 lines thick.
The plants commonly grow in tufts on stumps or dead trunks of deciduous
trees in or near woods. They may be found from September
to November. It is well to peel the caps before cooking. This species
is not classed as edible by European authors, but I find its flavor agreeable

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>The genus Flammula is not represented in our territory by a large
number of species. It is, nevertheless, not very sharply distinct from
the allied genera, Pholiota, Hebeloma and Naucoria. From Pholiota
it is especially separated by the slight development of the veil which is
merely fibrillose or entirely wanting. It never forms a persistent membranous
collar on the stem. From Hebeloma it may be distinguished
by the absence of a sinus at or near the inner extremity of the gills, by
the absence of white particles or mealiness from the upper part of the
stem and by the brighter or more distinctly rusty or ochraceous color of
the spores. From Naucoria the fleshy or fibrously fleshy stem affords
the most available distinguishing character. The genus belongs to the
Ochrosporæ or ochraceous-spored series, but the spores of its species
vary in color from ochraceous or tawny-ochraceous to rust-color or
brownish-rust color. The three things to be especially kept in mind in
order to recognize the species are the color of the spores, the adnate
or decurrent but not clearly sinuate gills and the fleshy or fibrously
fleshy stem without a membranous ring.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our species are mostly of medium size, none being very small and
one only meriting the appellation large. They appear chiefly in late
summer or in autumn and grow in woods or in wooded regions either
on the ground or more often on decaying wood. Many are gregarious
or cespitose in their mode of growth. Some have a bitterish or unpleasant
flavor and none of our species has yet been classed as edible. Fries
arranged the species in five groups, of which the names and more
prominent characters are here given. <cite>Peck</cite>, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Crepidoti correspond in shape
and habit to the smaller Pleuroti and
the Claudopodes, but they are distinguished
from both by the rust-color
of their spores. These are globose
in several species, in others they are
elliptical. In some there is a depression
on one side which gives them a
naviculoid character and causes the
spore to appear slightly curved when
viewed in a certain position. In consequence
of the similarity of several
of our species, the character of the spores is of much importance in
their identification, and it is unfortunate that European mycologists
have so generally neglected to give the spore characters in their
descriptions of these fungi. In most of the species the pileus is at first
resupinate, but it generally becomes reflexed as it enlarges. It is generally
sessile or attached by a mass of white fibrils or tomentum. For
this reason it is usually somewhat tomentose or villose about the point
of attachment, even in species that are otherwise glabrous. In several
species the pileus is moist or hygrophanous and then the thin margin is
commonly striatulate. This character is attributed to but one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>dozen or more European species. Their mode of growth is usually
gregarious or somewhat loosely imbricated, in consequence of which
the pileus, which in most species is white or yellowish, is often stained
by the spores, and then it has a rusty, stained or squalid appearance.
The species occur especially on old stumps, prostrate trunks and soft
much decayed wood in damp, shaded places. <cite>Peck</cite>, 39th Rep. N.Y.

<em>adorned with small, tawny, hairy or tomentose scales</em>. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> broad,
subventricose, moderately close, rounded behind, radiating from a lateral

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>Cortina</em>, a veil or curtain.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><strong>Veil</strong> resembling the consistency of a cob-web, superficial, distinct
from the cuticle of the pileus. <strong>Flesh</strong> of pileus and stem continuous.
<strong>Gills</strong> persistent, dry, changing color, powdered with the spores. <strong>Trama</strong>
fibrillose. <strong>Spores</strong> globose or oblong, somewhat ochraceous on white
paper. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>This genus is not easily confounded with any other, the cob-webby
veil stretched from stem to pileus in the young plant not being found in
other fungi. This must be looked for only in youth, as from its tender
character it soon breaks and often appears only as a very indistinct
collar on the stem, colored from catching the falling spores. The colors
are generally pronounced and often extremely bright, there being very
few prettier toadstools than those inclined to the blue or purple shades,
which are not uncommon in the immature form. The color of the
spores is also a marked feature, being rusty or brownish-ochraceous,
turning the gills to the same color at maturity. On account of this
change it is generally necessary to have specimens at both stages of
growth to accurately determine the species. The gills are thin, attached
to the stem in various manners, rarely slightly decurrent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cortinarius is distinguished from Flammula by growing on the ground
and by the bright ferruginous color of its spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cortinarius is a sturdy, hardy genus preferring northern latitudes and
autumnal months, though several of its species grow as far south as Alabama,
and one, a new species described by Professor Peck, is found on
the Helderberg mountains in May. The genus contains many species,
most of which produce in great numbers, yet being woods-growing, and
coming as they do when leaves are falling, they are often missed because
of their similarity to their surroundings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Heretofore, less than a dozen species have been reported as eaten.
This number is now doubled. While several species are bitter and others
equally unpleasant, not one has been accused of harm. It is highly
probable that other varieties than those herein given will prove equally
acceptable as food. I have tested all I have found in sufficient quantity
to warrant passing judgment upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The genus does not contain as many species of superior excellence as
other fleshy genera of like numbers. The flesh is frequently dry and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>a strong woody or musky flavor, which it does not lose in cooking. The
stems are seldom cookable. All can be fried in butter, but cut in small
pieces and well stewed, or stewed and served in patties, or made into
croquettes are certain ways of keeping them in palate memory.</p>

<p class='c000'>This interesting species is closely allied to Cortinarius multiformis and
belongs to the Section Phlegmacium. It has a slight odor of radishes
and is pronounced edible by Mr. McIlvaine. Its habitat is peculiar,
but it possibly finds its way into conservatories and mushroom beds
through the introduction of manure or soil, or leaf mold from the woods.
It seems strange, however, that it has not yet been detected growing in
the woods or fields. Hebeloma fastibile is said sometimes to invade
mushroom beds, and our plant resembles it in so many particulars that
it is with some hesitation I separate it. The chief differences are in
the stem and spores. The former, in Hebeloma fastibile, is described
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>as solid and fibrous-squamose and the latter as 10×6 micromillimeters
in size. The brighter color of the smaller spores and the stuffed or
hollow smooth stem of our plant will separate it from this species.

<p class='c000'>Cortinarius intrusus was a happy find. Several pints of it were collected
by the author in February—usually a famine month for the
mycophagist. They grew on the ground, in beds among plants, and
with potted plants in a hot-house in Haddonfield, N.J. The crop continued
well into the spring. The species is delicate, savory, and a most
accommodating renegade from its kind. I have never found it elsewhere.</p>

glabrous, glutinous when moist, shining
when dry. <strong>Gills</strong> rather broad,
dingy-white or grayish when young.
<strong>Stem</strong> cylindrical, solid, viscid or glutinous
when moist, transversely cracking
when dry, whitish or paler than
the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> subelliptical, 13–15µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Smeared cortinarius is much
more common than the Violet cortinarius
and has a much wider range.
Both the cap and stem are covered
with a viscid substance or gluten
which makes it unpleasant to handle.
The cap varies in color from yellow
to golden or tawny-yellow and when the gluten on it has dried it is
very smooth and shining. The flesh is white or whitish. The young
gills have a peculiar bluish-white or dingy-white color which might be
called grayish or clay color, but when mature they assume the color of
the spores. They are sometimes minutely uneven on the edge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stem is straight, solid, cylindrical and usually paler than the cap.
When the gluten on it dries it cracks transversely, giving to the stem a
peculiar scaly appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cap is 1½-3 in. broad, and the stem 2–4 in. long, and ¼-½
in. thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plant grows in thin woods, copses and partly cleared lands and
may be found from August to September.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is well to peel the caps before cooking, since the gluten causes dirt
and rubbish to adhere tenaciously to them. <cite>Peck</cite>, 48th Rep. N.Y.

<p class='c017'><strong>C. viola´ceus</strong> Fr. (Plate <a href='#plate082'>LXXXII</a>, fig. 2, page 306.) One of our
most plentiful and beautiful autumnal fungi. As the American plant
differs somewhat from the European, Professor Peck’s description is
given.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> convex, becoming nearly plane, dry, adorned with numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>persistent hairy tufts or scales, dark violet. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> rather thick, distant,
rounded or deeply notched at the inner extremity, colored like the
pileus in the young plant, brownish-cinnamon in the mature plant.
<strong>Stem</strong> solid, fibrillose, bulbous, colored like the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> subelliptical,
12.5µ long.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Violet cortinarius is a very beautiful mushroom and one easy of
recognition. At first the whole plant is uniformly colored, but with age
the gills assume a dingy ochraceous or brownish-cinnamon hue. The
cap is generally well formed and regular and is beautifully adorned with
little hairy scales or tufts. These are rarely shown in figures of the
European plant, but they are quite noticeable in the American plant and
should not be overlooked. The flesh is more or less tinged with violet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gills when young are colored like the cap. They are rather
broad, notched at the inner extremity and narrowed toward the margin
of the cap. When mature they become dusted with the spores whose
color they take.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stem also is colored like the cap. It is swollen into a bulb at
the base and sometimes a faint ochraceous band may be seen near the
top. This is due to the falling spores which lodge on the webby filaments
of the veil remaining attached to the stem.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Cap</strong> 2–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 3–5 in. long, about ½ in. thick. <cite>Peck</cite>,
48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Minerva, Essex county. A form of this species occurs here, having
the pileus merely downy or punctate-hairy under a lens, no squamules
being distinguishable by the naked eye. July. <cite>Peck</cite>, 50th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> 12–14×10µ <cite>Cooke</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spider web veil is exquisitely displayed in this species. This,
with its strongly bulbous base and violet tinge throughout, easily mark
it. Though usually solitary great numbers of it are found in its settlements.
The mixed woods of central New Jersey abound with it in July,
August and September. Throughout Pennsylvania and West Virginia
it is common, and is reported from several other states. In Redman’s
woods, near Haddonfield, N.J., a densely clustered form of singular
beauty occurs. A dozen individuals of various forms and sizes with
swollen stems form a compact mass, rich in color, and cutting crisp and
juicy as an apple. They are far better than other Cortinarii I have
eaten. I have not seen it elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>C. violaceus is everywhere eaten, and is in my opinion the best of its
genus. The American plant is not inodorous, but has a decided mushroom
smell and taste.</p>

These veils are not mentioned in Professor Peck’s description

above. In a very young specimen both veils were present. Cap light
brown, minutely squamulose, with a few small red spots; margin thin,
involute, flesh thick, yellowish, firm; gills distant, rounded behind,
slightly emarginate, alternate ones short, light brown inclined to cinereous

in. broad, fleshy, compact, convexo-plane
then depressed, smooth,
viscid when moist, shining when
dry, yellowish or tawny-ochraceous,
<em>strongly involute</em>, <em>margin
densely downy</em>, flesh pallid. <strong>Stem</strong>
2–4 in. high, about ½ in. thick,
solid, firm, paler than the pileus,
central or eccentric. <strong>Gills</strong> 2–3

<cite>Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It grows singly or in groups and likes damp mossy soil. Common
in cool hemlock or spruce woods in the Adirondack mountains; not
rare in the mixed woods of all our hilly districts. When growing on
decayed stumps the stem is sometimes eccentric. August, November.

<p class='c000'>In open woods near Haddonfield, N.J., it grows to a large size and
in quantity. In Angora woods near Philadelphia a complete ring of it
20 ft. in diameter was seen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Considered edible throughout Europe and said to be highly esteemed

minutely rivulose, sometimes tomentose in the center. <strong>Flesh</strong> white.
<strong>Stem</strong> 3–6 in. high, ½-1 in. thick, stout, solid, elastic, eccentric or
lateral, unequal rooting, <em>covered with dense velvety down, very dark

<p class='c000'>Found near Philadelphia, gregarious in old woods. September. In
New Jersey in pine woods on stumps and on the ground, probably
growing from roots. <cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Grows singly or cespitose, sometimes in large tufts, when the pileus is
frequently irregular from compression. In wet weather the pileus is
moist and sometimes obscurely mottled with dark spots. Occasionally
it has an unpleasant dirt-like odor. <cite>Peck.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Cordier considers this species suspicious and Paulet inutile on account
of its bad taste.</p>

<p class='c017'>Spores typically black-purple or brownish-purple, more rarely dusky
brown. (It is to be observed that the spores vary in color according to
the color of the ground on which they are deposited.) There are sterile
forms with the gills persistently white (A. obturatus, A. udus). Those
species are more deceptive in which the gills continue for a long time
white, and even begin to decay before they are discolored by the spores;
these may be easily mistaken for Leucospori. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Pratelli is the name given by the early authors to this series, based
upon the spore color; Porphyrosporæ is the name now used. The species
within the group are closely allied to those having black spores
without a tinge of purple or violet (Melanosporæ), but in none of the
species do the gills deliquesce as in Coprinus, neither are there resupinate
or lateral stemmed species.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a present tendency to do away with this series and include
all dark-spored species in the Melanosporæ. Professor Atkinson and
Bertha Stoneman, in their “Provisional Key to the Genera of Hymenomycetes,”
omit the series and give “Melanosporæ, Gill and Butz
(Pratellæ and Coprinariæ in broadest sense).
Spores dark brown, purplish-brown or black.”</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, flesh of the stem different from that of the pileus, furnished
with a distinct ring. <strong>Gills</strong> at first enclosed by the veil, free,
rounded behind, at first white or whitish, in some species this stage lasting
but a short time, then pink or reddish, at length dark purplish-brown
from the spores. <strong>Spores</strong> brown, brownish or reddish-purple.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the ground, generally in pastures, meadows or manured ground,
a few species occur in woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Analogous with Lepiota of the white-spored series. Stropharia also
bears a ring and has similar colored spores, but is separated by the flesh
of stem and pileus being continuous and the gills being more or less

<p class='c000'>Formerly in Agaricus as sub-genus Psalliota (<em>psallion</em>, <em>psalion</em>, in
poetry, a ring). When Psalliota was raised to generic rank it was given
the name of the great genus Agaricus as a mark of distinction on account
of its including the most widely known and useful mushroom of
the world—Agaricus campester. The name Psalliota is not in modern
use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Agaricus included many subgenera and consequently many more
species. Now it contains but few. All of them are highly flavored and of
marked excellence. Before the subgenera under Agaricus were promoted
to full generic standing it was customary to state the name of a species
thus: Agaricus (Psalliota) campester. Agaricus (Stropharia) semi-orbicularis.
This was lengthy and clumsy. In the older books this
form prevails. Often, however, the subgenus is omitted before the
name, which compels the student to look up the subgenus to which the
species belongs. The older books are therefore puzzling to modern
students, who find there simply the name Agaricus to guide them. The
present genus of a known species in old Agaricus can be easily found
by looking in the index for its specific name. The name of the genus
follows it in parentheses.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of the genus can be cooked in any desired way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The A. campester is known the world over as the common mushroom.
It is cosmopolitan, appearing in pastures and rich places from
spring and until long after severe frosts. It is the sweet morsel of gourmets.
Indirectly it has done more damage than the assembled viciousness
of all other toadstools. It is by mistaking the young button forms
of the deadly Amanita for the button forms of the common mushroom
that most cases of fatal toadstool poisoning are brought about. It is,
also, usually the persons who think they know the mushroom, and can
not be deceived, that get poisoned. If two rules are observed danger
can be avoided. (1) Never eat a fungus gathered in the woods believing
it to be the mushroom. The typical A. campester does not
grow in the woods; species of Agaricus somewhat resembling it do.
(2) Look at the gills; those of the mushroom are at first a light-pink
which rapidly, as the plant matures, darken to a dark-brown, purplish-brown,
or purplish-black. This is due to the ripening of the spores.
Those of the Amanita are constantly white.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pages could be written upon the mushroom and its culture, and recipes
for the cooking of it would fill a volume. One important thing is
omitted from them all—it is culinary heresy to peel a mushroom. Much
of the flavor lies in the skin, as it does in that of apples, apricots,
peaches, grapes, cherries and other fruits. The mushroom should be
wiped with a coarse flannel or towel until the skin is clean. See chapter
on cooking, etc.</p>

edibility. Its flesh is firm but crisp, not tough, and its flavor, though
not equal to that of the common mushroom, is nevertheless agreeable,
and its use as food is perfectly safe. <cite>Peck</cite>, Rep. 49.</p>

<p class='c000'>This species has grown freely for several years at Hull and Cohasset,
Mass. It is usually found about June 1st, and is not seen again until
early autumn. It is the handsomest mushroom I have seen, and its
edible qualities are on a par with its appearance. <cite>Macadam.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Sandy soil near salt water, Lynn, Mahant and Marblehead, Mass.
June to December. <cite>R.F. Dearborn.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>This is a very interesting and an excellent mushroom. Dr. Dearborn
writes that he has used it on the table for fourteen years and that it is
the only mushroom that he has ever eaten in which the stem is as good
as the cap. He considers it the most hearty and satisfying of all the
numerous species that he has ever eaten. Both its taste and odor is
suggestive of the sea. The latter is quite strong, and perceptible by
one riding along the road by whose side the mushrooms are growing.
They sometimes grow in semicircles and attain a larger size in warm
weather than in the colder weather of autumn. They are most abundant
in August. The flesh, when cut or broken, quickly assumes a pink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>or reddish hue on the freshly-exposed surface. This is a very distinctive
character and with the maritime habitat makes the species easy to recognize.
Another species, Agaricus hæmorrhoidarius Kalchb. exhibits
a similar change of color in its wounded flesh, but is of very rare occurrence
with us, does not, so far as ascertained, grow near the sea, has a
darker cap and a long hollow stem. The stem in the maritime mushroom
is short and solid. Its collar is very slight and easily destroyed.

from A. campestris, but that it is diverse in some respects;
its white flesh being unchangeable, its gills never deliquescing, remaining
a long time pale and not becoming dark-red in middle age. Berkeley

<p class='c000'>Unless the numerical system of John Ph&oelig;nix to express degrees of
quality is adopted by a mycophagists' congress, and one species of
fungus is chosen as the standard of excellence, the comparative excellence
of species will never be settled. English epicures shun A.
arvensis; the French prefer it. Berkeley says it is inferior to the common
mushroom; Vittadini says it is very sapid and very nutritious. So
opinion varies. Individual tastes must decide excellence. Comparison
never will. Toadstools differ in substance, texture and taste as one
meat or vegetable differs from another. Beef could not be chosen as
the standard for meats, or cabbage as the standard for vegetables.

<p class='c000'>West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, June to frost. <cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>A. silvicola, by many authors considered a variety of A. campester,
is, seemingly, becoming common. Professor Peck in 46th Rep. has
made the abrupt bulb and its usual double veil distinctive marks which
ally it to A. arvensis. He therefore calls it var. abruptus. As this
book goes to press Professor Peck writes me that he concludes var.
abruptus to be a good and distinct species. It is therefore given as
such. While familiar with it since 1881, I never found it in quantity
until 1898, at Mt. Gretna, Pa. There, among the straw and rubbish
of abandoned camps on wood margins, it grew in great quantity;
sometimes singly, at others in crowded clusters. When growing singly
it exhibits all the characteristics of its description; when clustered,
the stems are not always bulbous. The caps are thin but fleshy,
brittle and bear a disproportionate width to the stem—like a plate on
a pipe stem. The caps when mature are usually tinged with yellow and
are spread flat; the ring is large, often double, yellowish, often torn,
fragments of it frequently hang from the cap margin; the bulb when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>perfect is small, abrupt, as if it had once been round but the stem
pushed into it. It has a strong spicy mushroom odor and taste, and
makes a high-flavored dish. It is delicious with meats. It is the
very best mushroom for catsup. Mixed with Russulæ or Lactarii or
other species lacking in mushroom flavor, it enriches the entire dish.
The stems, excepting of the very young, are tough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Larvæ do not infest A. silvicola. Its habit of growth shows it to be
cultivatable. It has but one draw-back. Growing as it does in woods
and in the presence of the poisonous Amanita, it is possible for the
careless collector to confound the two. The Amanitæ have larger bulbs,
cups at the base, and <em>white gills</em>; the A. silvicola has no volva, has
whitish gills when very young only, they become pinkish, then a marked
blackish-brown.</p>

of almonds.</p>

stained with yellow. <strong>Spores</strong> elliptical, 5–6.5µ long.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Cap</strong> 2–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 3–5 in. long, ¼ to nearly ½ in. thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>It grows in the borders of hemlock woods or under hemlock trees
from July to September. It has been eaten by Mr. C.L. Shear, who
pronounces it very good. I have not found it in sufficient quantity to
give it a trial. This mushroom is very closely related to the wood
mushroom or silvan mushroom, Agaricus silvaticus, a species which is
also recorded as edible, but which is apparently more rare in our state
(New York) than even the flat-cap mushroom. This differs from the
silvan mushroom in its paler color, in having the cap more minutely,
persistently and regularly scaly, and in its being destitute of a prominent
center. In the silvan mushroom the scales, when present, are few, and
they disappear with age. <cite>Peck</cite>, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. E.C. Anthony, Gouverneur, N.Y., June, 1898, writes: “In
great abundance on lawn, tumbling over one another in their haste to
make their appearance. One of the largest, which did not have half a
chance to display its proportions, would probably measure 7 in., perhaps
more. When mature they crack across the top, showing the white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>flesh. The gills are pink, stem white, solid and bulbous. There is no
perceptible odor when fresh.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Indiana, <cite>H.I. Miller</cite>, edible, good.</p>

<p class='c000'>Specimens sent to me by Mrs. Anthony, though not fresh, were eaten
by me. They very much resembled the common mushroom, but probably,
owing to their condition, were not so tender.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have not found the species. The illustration is after a painting by
Mrs. E.C. Anthony.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>A. varia´bilis</strong> Pk.—variable. (Plate <a href='#plate091'>XCI</a>, fig. 1, p. 332.) <strong>Cap</strong>
2–6 in. across, ovate, bell-shaped, irregularly convex and wavy, margin
incurved but never striate, smooth, minutely fibrillose, with few remaining
floccose scales; mature plant pure white, when young distinctly
tinged with lilac and here and there with yellow when mature, slightly,
broadly umbonate and depressed around umbo, cracks along gills.
<strong>Flesh</strong> thick in center, very thin, even membranaceous toward margin,
spongy, unchangeable. <strong>Gills</strong> free, close, thin, flaccid, ventricose, narrow
next stem, but few short, pure-white when young, then dark-umber
without purple tinge. <strong>Stem</strong> equal, tubed, white, silky, smooth above
ring, rippled and minutely furfuraceous (scurfy) below, flocculose-furfuraceous
when young, densely hairy at base, and occasionally slightly
expanding, but not bulbous, densely cespitose with a coarse, white,
root-like mycelium. <strong>Veil</strong> heavy at first, mottled with yellow scales beneath;
as cap expands veil becomes thin, like tissue paper, ruptures at
both stem and margin leaving torn ring on stem and appendiculate fragments
on edge of cap.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> shed in great quantity, rich dark umber-brown without shade
of purple.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Taste</strong> strong like almond. <strong>Smell</strong> slightly of musk, like the running
mycelium of A. campester.</p>

<p class='c000'>Found at Mt. Gretna, Pa. <cite>Charles McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>I have never found worms in this species. It is very prolific and its
habitat shows that it can be cultivated. Its freedom from worms and
lasting carrying quality will make it commercially valuable.</p>

<p class='c000'>It grew in an old roofless stable from September until after several
frosts, in enormous quantity, 25 or 30 pounds in a patch. It differs
from A. subrufescens in not having a shade of red about it, in its very
distinct light-lilac cap when full grown, and in its snow-white youth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>The young gills are pure white as are the caps. The stems sometimes
taper upward, but they are usually remarkably equal.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is delicate when cooked and of excellent flavor.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>A. tabula´ris</strong> Pk.—relating to boards. <strong>Pileus</strong> 5–10 cm. broad, very
thick, fleshy, firm, convex, deeply cracked in areas, whitish, flesh whitish,
tinged with yellow, the areas pyramidal, truncate, the sides horizontally
striate, their apices sometimes tomentose. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> narrow,
close, free, blackish-brown when mature. <strong>Stem</strong> short, thick, solid.
<strong>Spores</strong> broadly elliptical, 7.5–9µ long, 6–7.5µ broad, generally containing
a single large nucleus.</p>

<p class='c000'>In clay soil by roadsides. Craig, Colorado. August. <cite>E. Bethel.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>This species is remarkable for the peculiar upper surface of the pileus
which is broken into pyramidal areas. The sides of these are marked
by parallel lines in such a way that they appear as if formed by small
tablets placed one upon another, each successive tablet being a little
smaller than the one immediately preceding it. Only dried and broken
specimens have been seen by me and the notes of the collector do not
give the color of the young lamellæ. There is a trace of a thick ring on
the broken stem of one specimen. <cite>Peck</cite>, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol.

poisonous. So far as carefully tested by the writer no doubtful one has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>been encountered, and one—semiglobata—has been eaten by himself

intensely verdigris or azure-blue-pelliculose and very glutinous. From
this there is a long series of forms with the gluten more separating (on
the separation of the gluten the pileus becomes yellow), and the scales
alike of the pileus and stem rubbed off. Finally, a smaller form occurs
in open meadows, stem scarcely 2 in. long, only 2 lines thick, becoming

<p class='c017'>Members of this purple-spored genus grow upon decayed wood,
either standing or as roots in the ground, or from ground heavily laden
with woody material. They grow singly, in groups, or in densely-tufted
or overlapping masses. The several species vary in shades of
yellow, red, orange, brick-color and brown; their caps are from 1–6 in.
across; their stems are short or long, as the number in the cluster permits;
when growing singly the stems are short and sturdy. There is a
floccose veil, or remnants of one, about the stem. The gills are yellowish,
greenish, olivaceous or greenish shades of yellow, gray, purple,
almost black. They are showy, easily recognized and are found from
September until mid-winter. I have gathered them when frozen hard.
The flesh is solid, or spongy, flexible or fragile, white or yellowish; the
tastes are sweet, nutty, bitter and saponaceous. Patches of them—and
they are frequent in almost every woods in the land—often yield several
bushels. Tons of them annually go to waste.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old authors and some copyists say “the species are not edible, the
tough ones being bitter, the fragile ones almost void of flesh.” Eighteen
years of experience with them warrants my saying that there is not a
single wild genus approaching it in economic value, and when its most
prominent species are properly cooked, few equal it in consistency and
flavor. As a pickle the Hypholomas have no superior.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Half a dozen or more of the species are exceedingly difficult to separate.
Professor Peck has happily made a new species, H. perplexum,
which is well named. For all culinary purposes these affiliated species
may be gathered under that convenient name; for botanic purposes his
description covers several perplexing characteristics common to what
have been written as separate species, and covers a composite species.</p>

<p class='c000'>The occasional bitter taste of some species is not constant, and can
not be relied upon as a distinguishing mark. In the same tufts some
individuals may be mild, others bitter; some individuals in groups are in
a position and of an age to absorb water; others are not. There will
be a marked difference in their taste raw. A few in the same group may
have been infested by insects; others not. Those infested are often intensely
bitter, while their companions are of pleasant flavor. The same
remarks apply to neighboring clusters and individuals. I am of the
opinion, from long observation, that the bitter is largely due to the injury
and excrement of larvæ. Changes of taste occur in toadstools in
a most marked and rapid manner. Apples from the same tree, chestnuts
from the same tree, acorns from the same oak, radishes from the
same seed, blackberries from the same bush, differ widely in taste. Why
not toadstools of the same species?</p>

<p class='c000'>I have often seen species of this genus, described as having stems up
to 5 in. long, stretch and twist their stems to over a foot in order to get
their caps from the inside of, or from a crack in a decaying stump, out into
the light; and I have seen stems of the same species stout, solid and
sturdy when individuals grew upright and singly. But wherever and
however they grow, Hypholomas are safe. I have eaten them indiscriminately
since 1881, and as long ago as 1885 published their edibility.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>The Perplexing hypholoma has received the name because it is one
of a group of five or six very closely allied species, whose separation
from each other is somewhat difficult and perplexing. Of these six
species three have a decidedly bitter, unpleasant flavor, and three are
mild, or not decidedly bitter, if we may rely on the published descriptions
of them. The three bitter ones, also, have no purplish tints to
the mature gills; but two of the mild ones have. By using these and
other distinguishing characters the six species may be tabulated and
their several peculiarities more clearly shown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably in general appearance the Perplexing hypholoma most
nearly resembles the brick-red Hypholoma, H. sublateritium; but it has
often been mistaken for the tufted Hypholoma, H. fasciculare. From
this it may be separated by the more red cap, the whitish flesh, the
purplish-brown color of the mature gills, and the mild flavor. From H.
sublateritium it is distinguished by its usually smaller size, more slender
hollow stem, the yellow greenish and purplish tints of the gills, and the
absence of a bitter flavor. Some may prefer to consider it a variety of
this fungus, rather than a distinct species.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its cap is 1–3 in. broad, its stem 2–3 in. long and 2–4 lines thick.
It commonly grows in clusters, though sometimes singly, on or about
old stumps or prostrate trunks of trees, in woods or open places. The
caps of the lower ones in a cluster are often defiled and apparently discolored
by the spores that have lodged on them from the upper ones.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>It appears in autumn, and continues until freezing weather stops its
growth. It is a very common species, as well as a late one, and may
often be gathered in large quantity. Its flavor is not first quality, but
with good preparation it makes a very acceptable dish. It has been
tested by myself and correspondents several times, and has been proved
harmless. <cite>Peck</cite>, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>H. perplexum is abundant in most if not all the states. I have eaten
it and its allied species since 1881; dried them, pickled them, and fed

and appetite by calling it H. perplexum and graciously eating it.</p>

solitary. It is then short-stemmed and sturdy. There are several

Old authors give it as bitter and poisonous. The bitter is
not always present. Any there is disappears in cooking. It is not
poisonous, but one of our most valuable species. I have eaten it since

When growing singly from roots or from ground heavily charged

modified. Except for botanic purposes there is no occasion to puzzle

Various as are the spore colors in this series (in
its broadest sense), there is an entire absence of
brown and purple shades in the black spores of four
of the genera belonging to this group or series. In
Gomphidius the spores are dingy-olivaceous. It
is an outsider affiliating with thoroughbreds because
of more technical congeniality than other genera
afford. Like comets in the universe, it has no
home. The singular genus Montagnites (of which but one species has
been found in America, and that in Texas) has the relationship of
spore-color. Panæolus, Anellaria, Psathyrella, when young, have gills
free from each other; Coprinus, in early life, presents them pressed
tightly together; as the plants age and the spores ripen, the entire gill
structure becomes black and dissolves into an inky fluid, the color of
which is due to the spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>The species are all of delicate body, and many of them add generously
to table luxuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extreme closeness of the gills and their entire deliquescence into
a fluid, black from the spores, sharply define this genus and separate it
from all others. At first the form is oval or cylindrical; most are
furnished with a downy or scurfy veil often adhering to the pileus,
sometimes forming an adhering volva at the base of the stem. Nearly
all are ephemeral, many completely disappearing in a day.</p>

species.</p>

wood and other materials. Bolbitius, the only ally, has the same
ephemeral existence, and grows in similar situations, but the gills only
soften (not melting) and the spores are somewhat rust-colored.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blackening of the gills is not a process of decay, but is due to
the growth of the spores, and the plant is still (before deliquescence)
perfectly edible although not so inviting in appearance as before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Species of Coprinus are very common and are easily recognized by
the deliquescent gills which, when mature, stain the fingers black.</p>

<p class='c000'>In “Once upon a Time,” when country people made their own writing
inks, the convenient Coprinus gave its juices for this purpose. A
little corrosive sublimate added to the boiled and strained fluid prevented
it from molding.</p>

<p class='c000'>With few exceptions the species are small. They are tender, of real
mushroom flavor and highly enjoyable. They make a thin, well flavored
catsup, but are better used to give flavor to their less favored brethren.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are six species given as found in the United States—B. cavipes
Kalchb., B. pictus Pk., B. paluster Pk., B. decipiens Pk., B. porosus
Pk., B. appendiculatus Pk.—of these I have found and eaten four. B.
decipiens has, at this writing, not been seen by Professor Peck, but
Professor Farlow, of Harvard, has informed him of authentic specimens.
There is every probability of its being as edible as the others; a description
of it is, therefore, given.</p>

<p class='c000'>In consistency Boletinus is of the best, being rather like that of marshmallows,
and the same as Boletus subaureus. The flavor is mild and
pleasant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck mentions that the smell of B. porosus is sometimes
unpleasant. I have been fortunate in not having had this experience.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. ca´vipes</strong> Kalchb. <strong>Pileus</strong> broadly convex, rather tough, flexible,
soft, subumbonate, fibrillose-scaly, tawny-brown, sometimes tinged with
reddish or purplish. <strong>Flesh</strong> yellowish. <strong>Tubes</strong> slightly decurrent, at first
pale-yellow, then darker and tinged with green, becoming dingy-ochraceous
with age. <strong>Stem</strong> equal or slightly tapering upward, somewhat
fibrillose or floccose, slightly ringed, <em>hollow</em>, tawny-brown or yellowish-brown,
yellowish at the top and marked by the decurrent dissepiments
of the tubes, white within. <strong>Veil</strong> whitish, partly adhering to the margin
of the pileus, soon disappearing. <strong>Spores</strong> 8–10×4µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 1.5–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 1.5–3 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.
Swamps and damp mossy ground under or near tamarack trees. New
York, <cite>Peck</cite>; New England, <cite>Frost</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pileus is clothed with a fibrillose tomentum which becomes more
or less united into floccose tufts or scales. The umbo is not always
present and is generally small. The young stem may sometimes be
stuffed, but, if so, it soon becomes hollow, though the cavity is irregular.
The freshly shed spores have a greenish-yellow or olivaceous hue,
but in time they assume a pale or yellowish-ochraceous hue. This species
is apparently northern in its range. It loves cold sphagnous
swamps in mountainous regions. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

best in patties, croquettes and escallops.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. appendicula´tus</strong> Pk. <strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, convex, glabrous, ochraceous-yellow,

to dull pinkish or reddish tints where wounded. <strong>Tubes</strong> tenacious, at
first pale yellow, becoming darker or dingy ochraceous with age, sometimes
changing to pinkish-brown where bruised, concealed in the young
plant by the copious whitish webby veil. <strong>Stem</strong> equal or nearly so,

<p class='c000'>Specimens of this species have not been seen by me. The authors
remark that its affinities are clearly with Boletinus flavidus and its allies,
from which it is distinguished by its large radiating pores. They also
say that when dry it is scarcely distinguishable from Paxillus porosus
Berk., except by its spores. This would imply that its stem is eccentric
or lateral, and I have been informed by Mr. Ravenel that it is sometimes
so. But specimens of this kind, labeled Boletinus decipiens B.
and C., have been received, which show by their spores that they are
Paxillus porosus. Besides, Professor Farlow informs me that authentic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>specimens of B. decipiens in the Curtisian Herbarium have only central
stems, from which things I suspect that the two species have been confused.

in the Curtis Herbarium, through the kindness of Professor Farlow.

<p class='c017'><strong>B. poro´sus</strong> (Berk.) Pk. (Plate <a href='#plate113'>CXIII</a>.) <strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, viscid when
moist, shining, reddish-brown. <strong>Flesh</strong> 3–9 lines thick, the margin thin
and even; hymenium porous, yellow, formed by radiating lamellæ a line
to half a line distant, branching and connected by numerous irregular
veins of less prominence and forming large angular pores. <strong>Stem</strong> lateral,
tough, diffused into the pileus, reticulated at the top by the decurrent
walls of the tubes, colored like the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> semi-ovate.</p>

<p class='c000'>This species is remarkable for its lateral or eccentric stem. There
is often an emargination in the pileus on the side of the stem which
gives it a kidney shape. In the typical form it is described as viscid
when moist, and the Wisconsin plant is also described as viscid, but in
all the New York specimens that I have seen it is dry and sometimes
minutely tomentose. I have, therefore, separated these as a variety.
The color of the pileus varies from yellowish-brown to reddish-brown or
umber. A disagreeable odor is sometimes present. The tubes are
rather short and tough and do not easily separate from the hymenophore
and from each other. In the young plant they are not separable.
They sometimes become slightly blue where wounded. As in other
species they are pale yellow when young, but become darker or dingy-ochraceous
with age. The spores have been described as bright yellow,
but I do not find them so in the New York plant. The plant is
incongruous among the Paxilli by reason of its wholly porous hymenium,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>but in this place it seems to be among its true allies. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of
the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fine specimens were sent to me by Mr. H.I. Miller, Terre Haute,
and Dr. J.R. Weist, Richmond, Ind. They were in condition to be
eaten and enjoyed. No disagreeable odor was perceptible.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. borea´lis</strong> Pk. <strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, convex, obtuse or subumbonate,

The name of a fungus considered a great delicacy
among the Romans, derived from <em>bolos</em>, a clod,
probably to denote the round figure of the plant.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Hymenium</strong> wholly composed of small tubes,
connected together in a stratum, the surface of
which is dotted with their poriform mouths, and
which is distinct from the hymenophore on account
of the latter not descending into a trama. <strong>Tubes</strong> packed close
together, easily separating from the hymenophore and from one another.
<strong>Pores</strong> or mouths of the tubes round or angular (in the subgenus Gyrodon
sinuous or gyroso-plicate). <strong>Spores</strong> normally fusiform, rarely oval or
somewhat round. <em>Growing on the ground, fleshy, putrescent, with central
stems. Mostly edible, and of importance as articles of food; a few
poisonous.</em> <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>No American species in Gyrodon. It is therefore omitted in synopsis
of tribes. <cite>C.M.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>This genus abounds in species and is related to Boletinus on one hand
and to Polyporus on the other. From the latter it is distinguished by
the absence of a trama and from both by the tubes being easily separable
from the hymenophore and from each other. Some of the species
are very variable, others are so closely allied that they appear to almost
run together.</p>

<p class='c000'>The species are generally terrestrial, but B. hemichrysus is habitually
wood-growing, and others are occasionally so.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spores vary so much in color in such closely related species that
this character is scarcely available for general classification, but it is valuable
as a specific character and should always be noted.</p>

<p class='c000'>C.H. Peck, N.Y. State Botanist, has contributed to Mycological
literature his careful arrangement and analysis of species of this genus,
in his “Boleti of the United States.” Species of the genus are found in
every state of the Union. Several species are common to all the states.
Comprehending, as do the states, all sorts of climates within their vast
range of latitude, differences in appearance and structure in the same
species must be expected, dependent largely, as they are in most fungi,
upon habitat and environment. These variations will frequently suggest
new species. Descriptions which are typical and which can be
recognized as standard are most desirable. Professor Peck’s are accepted
by the writer as such, that there may be uniformity, and are
quoted as fully as space will permit. Such variations as are attributable
to locality will be noted.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>Since 1882 the writer has given great attention to the edible qualities
of the Boleti. He is convinced by many personal tests and those made
by his family and friends, that much, if not all, of the suspicion thrown
about Boleti is unjust and erroneous. He is able to state positively that
change of color when bruised or broken; bitter and pepperiness have
nothing whatever to do with the edible qualities of species exhibiting
them, excepting in B. felleus, which exhibits an intense bitter, not lost
in cooking. It is not poisonous.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer has the courage of his convictions, and has taken interest
in eating species with a bad reputation whenever opportunity afforded,
that their just dues might be given them. He has never experienced
the slightest inconvenience. But others may not be so fortunate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before cooking Boleti the stem, unless crisp and tender, should be
removed, as should the tubes unless young and fresh. They broil, fry,
stew, make good soups and dry well. See recipes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is believed that all species of Boleti up to this time found in
America are described in this volume. When no remarks of the writer
follow the descriptions, he has not had an opportunity to test the edible
quality of the species.</p>

a bright-yellow color. When young, the tomentose veil covers the
whole plant, but it soon parts into scales on the pileus and partly or

needles, sand, anything through which it grows, adheres to the glutinous
cap. It must be carefully cleaned before cooking. It is then of

<p class='c000'>This plant might almost be considered a stout variety of the preceding,
but in addition to its thicker pileus and stouter stem, it has smaller
tubes of a clearer yellow color, and the exuding drops are yellow, not
whitish, as in that species. In habit it appears more like B. granulatus,
from which it is distinct in color. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>From early October, through heavy frosts and until long after November
snows I found this species at Mt. Gretna, Pa., in 1897–1898.
Specimens were sent to Professor Peck and identified as this species. It
grew in grass on borders of woods, or gravelly ground, sometimes
among pine needles. Large troops of it were frequent, and tufts containing
many individuals were common.</p>

<p class='c000'>I regard B. subaureus as among the most valuable of our food species.
Its plentifulness, lateness, excellent quality will commend it to all Mycophagists.
It can be cooked in any way. The tubes need not be removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>This species may easily be recognized by its peppery flavor. The
pileus sometimes appears as if slightly tomentose, and both this and the
preceding species recede from the character of the tribe by the slight
viscidity of the pileus. This is sometimes cracked into areas and sometimes
the margin is very obtuse by the elongation of the tubes. <cite>Peck</cite>,

<p class='c017'><strong>B. subsanguin´eus</strong> Pk.—<em>sub</em> and <em>sanguineus</em>, bloody. (Plate <a href='#plate116'>CXVI</a>,
fig. 4, p. 420.) <strong>Pileus</strong> convex or slightly depressed in the center, glabrous,
viscid, bright-red or scarlet. <strong>Flesh</strong> thick, firm but flexible, white,
slowly changing to a pale brownish-lilac on exposure to the air, taste
slightly bitter. <strong>Tubes</strong> very short, 2–4 mm. long, adnate, but often separating
from the stem with the expansion of the pileus, reddish, the
mouths minute, stuffed at first, pinkish, then brownish-yellow, changing
to a light-brown where wounded. <strong>Stem</strong> short, thick, uneven, often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>tapering downward, streaked with red, pale-yellow at the top, white at
the base, marked at the top by the decurrent walls of the tubes.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 2.5–10 cm. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 2.5–5 cm. long, 2–4 cm. thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Solitary, gregarious or cespitose. Under beech trees. West Philadelphia,
Pa. August. <cite>C. McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>This is a very showy species, easily recognized by its bright-red viscid
pileus and its short, thick and uneven or somewhat lacunose stem.
It is closely related to the European B. sanguineus With., from which
it is separated by its minute tubes, its uneven stem and the brownish
hues assumed where wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spore characters of this and the four succeeding species are unknown,
but the other characters are quite distinctive and apparently
sufficient for the recognition of the species. The descriptions have been
derived from colored figures and other data furnished by Mr. McIlvaine,
who says all are edible. <cite>Peck</cite>, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, No. 27.</p>

<p class='c000'>When slowly stewed for thirty minutes, there is no better Boletus.</p>

<p class='c026'><strong>Pileus</strong> clothed with a yellow dust or a yellow powdery down. <strong>Stem</strong>

<p class='c000'>The species which constitute this tribe are easily distinguished from
all others by the sulphur-colored pulverulence which coats the pileus
and stem like a universal veil. They appear thus far to be peculiar to
this country. Though strongly resembling each other in the tribal
character they are very diverse in other respects. One species, by its
viscidity, connects with the preceding tribe; another by its differently
colored tube mouths is related to the Luridi; and the third is peculiar
in its ligneous habitat.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. hemichry´sus</strong> B. and C.—half-golden. <strong>Pileus</strong> convex, at length

<p class='c000'>The species is remarkable for its habitat, which is lignicolous. The
New York variety grew on a stump of white pine. By its eccentric
stem it connects this genus with Boletinus, through Boletinus porosus.
According to the authors of this species it resembles Boletus variegatus.

<p class='c017'><strong>B. Ravenel´ii</strong> B. and C.—after Ravenel. <strong>Pileus</strong> convex or nearly
plane, <em>slightly viscid when young or moist</em>, covered with a sulphur-yellow
powdery down, becoming naked and dull-red on the disk. <strong>Flesh</strong>
whitish. <strong>Tubes</strong> at first plane, <em>adnate</em>, pale-yellow, becoming yellowish-brown
or umber, dingy-greenish where bruised, the mouths large or
medium size, subrotund. <strong>Stem</strong> nearly equal, clothed and colored like
the young pileus, yellow within, with a slight evanescent webby or
tomentose ring. <strong>Spores</strong> ochraceous-brown, 10–12×5–6µ.</p>

New York, <cite>Peck</cite>; New England, <cite>Frost</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a very distinct and very beautiful species. Mr. Ravenel remarks
in his notes that “this plant is not infested by larvæ and preserves
more constant characters than any other Boletus with which I am acquainted.”
The webby powdered filaments constitute a universal veil
which at first covers the whole plant and conceals the young tubes. As
the pileus expands this generally disappears from the disk, and, separating
between the margin and the stem, a part adheres to each. The
flesh is sometimes stained with yellow. The tubes in some instances become
convex and slightly depressed around the stem. They are almost
white when young, and often exhibit brownish hues where wounded.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>The plant is sometimes cespitose. I have observed a greenish tint to
the freshly shed spores, but it soon disappears. Boletus subchromeus
Frost Ms. is this species. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. auriflam´meus</strong> B. and C.—flaming yellow. <strong>Pileus</strong> convex, <em>dry</em>,
powdered, bright golden-yellow. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, unchangeable. <strong>Tubes</strong>
plane or convex, <em>free</em>, yellow, their broad angular <em>mouths scarlet</em>. <strong>Stem</strong>
slightly tapering upward, powdered, colored like the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong>
10–12.5×5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 8–12 lines broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 1–1.5 in. long.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods. North Carolina, <cite>Curtis</cite>; New York, <cite>Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is evidently a rare species and as beautiful as it is rare. The
whole plant is bright-yellow except the tube mouths, and is sprinkled
with yellow dust or minute yellow branny particles. In the New York
specimen the scarlet color is wanting in the marginal tube mouths and
the stem is marked with fine subreticulating elevated lines. In other
respects it agrees well with the diagnosis of the species. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti
of the U.S.</p>

<h5 class='c029'><span class='sc'>Subpruinosi</span>—<em>sub</em>, <em>pruina</em>, hoar frost.</h5>

<p class='c026'><strong>Pileus</strong> glabrous, but more often pruinose. <strong>Tubes</strong> adnate, yellowish.
<strong>Stem</strong> equal, even, neither bulbous nor reticulated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The species of this tribe have the pileus neither viscid nor distinctly
and permanently tomentose. Typically it is glabrous or merely pruinose,
but Fries has admitted into the group one species with a pulverulent,
and one with a silky pileus. The species are not sharply distinguished
from those of the following tribes, and possibly some have been admitted
here which might as well have been placed there. Some of the species
are variable in color and their characters are not sufficiently well known.</p>

have subjoined it here. In it every part of the plant quickly changes
to blue where wounded, and even the pressure of the fingers in handling
the fresh specimens is sufficient to induce this change of color. I have
not found the typical plant in New York, but specimens received from
Mr. Frost are not, in the dry state, distinguishable from the variety.

<p class='c000'>The smoothish-stemmed Boletus is well marked by its cylindric minutely
scurfy stem which is colored like the tubes. Its cap is smooth
and nearly always some shade of red or bay. Specimens occur occasionally
in which it approaches grayish-brown or wood-brown. The
flesh is white and unchangeable when cut or broken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tubes at first have a nearly plane surface, but this becomes somewhat
convex with age, and slightly depressed around the stem. The
tube mouths are small and nearly round. The color of the tubes is at
first a beautiful pale yellow, but it becomes darker or slightly greenish-yellow
with age.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stem is colored very nearly like the tubes, but sometimes it has
a slight reddish tint toward the base. Its peculiar feature consists of
the minute, branny particles upon it. They are so small and pale that
they are easily overlooked.</p>

in Woodland Cemetery and Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. If the
tubes are not removed the dish is slimy. The B. chrysenteron also
makes such a dish when stewed, but fried, and well done, both species
are decidedly good.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the American plant Mr. Morgan says that the pileus is quite firm
and dry, becomes reddish or brownish-yellow and nearly glabrous,
that the flesh is pale-yellow, but that he has not observed any bluish
tinge, and that the spores are olive, fusiform, 10–12.5×5µ. Those of the
European plant have been described as very pale ocher, almost white,
6µ long, 3µ broad. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several specimens brought to me were eaten. The change in color
of flesh was instantaneous upon exposure to the air. Taste strong and
raw rather than bitterish. The caps alone were cooked, and dish marked
“fine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The truncate or beveled margin of the pileus is a striking feature in
this species. It is about 4 mm. broad and as even as if cut with a
knife. Sometimes the surface of the stem ruptures transversely just below
the top, the liberated shreds above curling upward against the tubes
and those below curving outward and downward. In mature plants
brownish spots appear in the flesh of the pileus. “When cooked it is
of high flavor and tender as kidney,” <cite>C. McIlvaine.</cite> <cite>Peck</cite>, Bull. Torrey

<p class='c017'><strong>B. Rus´selli</strong> Frost—Russell’s Boletus. (Plate <a href='#plate118'>CXVIII</a>, fig. 2, p. 436.)
<strong>Pileus</strong> thick, hemispherical or convex, <em>dry, covered with downy scales or
bundles of red hairs</em>, yellowish beneath the tomentum, often cracked in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>areas. <strong>Flesh</strong> yellowish, unchangeable. <strong>Tubes</strong> subadnate, often depressed
around the stem, rather large, dingy-yellow or yellowish-green.
<strong>Stem</strong> very long, equal or tapering upward, roughened by the lacerated
margins of the reticular depressions, <em>red or brownish-red</em>. <strong>Spores</strong> olive-brown,
18–22×8–10µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 1.5–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 3–7 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is distinguished from the other species by the dry squamulose
pileus and the color of the stem. The latter is sometimes curved at the
base. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>B. Russelli occurs in the West Virginia mountains, where I found
and ate it in August, 1883. Though solitary in its method of growth,
it is frequent in many parts of Pennsylvania, among leaves in mixed
woods. August to October.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taste when raw, sweet, mild. Cooked it is rather soft, tasty. Tubes
and stem should be removed.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. Mor´gani</strong> Pk. <strong>Pileus</strong> convex, soft, <em>glabrous viscid</em>, red or yellow,
or red fading to yellow on the margin. <strong>Flesh</strong> whitish tinged with
red and yellow, unchangeable. <strong>Tubes</strong> convex, depressed around the
stem, rather long and large, bright-yellow becoming greenish-yellow.
<strong>Stem</strong> elongated, tapering upward, pitted with long, narrow depressions,
<em>yellow, red in the depressions</em>, colored within like the flesh of the pileus.
<strong>Spores</strong> olive-brown, 18–22µ long, about half as broad.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 1.5–2.5 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 3–5 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rocky hillsides in woods of deciduous trees. Kentucky, <cite>Morgan</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In wet weather the anastomosing ridges of the stem swell and become
broadly winged, thereby giving the stem a peculiar lacerated appearance.
The glabrous viscid pileus and the coloration of the stem distinguish
the species. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>B. Morgani is found in like localities with B. Russelli. Excepting in
its smooth, viscid cap and whitish flesh, it closely resembles the latter.
The ridges in the stems of both species swell when moist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its edible qualities are the same as B. Russelli.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. Be´tula</strong> Schw.—birch. <strong>Pileus</strong> convex, viscose and shining in wet
weather, tessellately cracked and reticulated, orange-fawn color, rather
small. <strong>Flesh</strong> yellowish-white. <strong>Tubes</strong> separating, rather large, <em>yellow</em>,
almost like those of B. subtomentosus but <em>not greenish</em>. <strong>Stem</strong> long,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span><em>attenuated downward</em>, everywhere covered with a deciduous reticulated
bark two lines high and separating like the bark of birches, <em>pale-yellow
without and within</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edible qualities good.</p>

<h5 class='c029'><span class='sc'>Calo´podes.</span> <i>Gr</i>—beautiful; <i>Gr</i>—feet.</h5>

<p class='c026'><strong>Stem</strong> stout, at first bulbous, typically venose-reticulated with veins.
<strong>Tubes</strong> adnate, their mouths not reddish.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reticulate stem and adnate tubes of one color distinguish the
species of this tribe. In the Luridi the mouths of the tubes are differently
colored, and in the closely related Edules the tubes are more or
less depressed around the stem or sub-free, and their pores are commonly
stuffed when young. Fries did not admit species with whitish
tubes into this tribe, but we have done so in those cases in which this
was the only character to exclude them.</p>

the finder to over and over again try cooking it, hoping the discovery of
a successful way to rid it of its unpleasantness. I have never succeeded.

ochraceous yellow. <strong>Stem</strong> mostly obclavate (inversely club-shaped)
and reticulate to the base. <strong>Spores</strong> oblong-fusiform, 12–15×4–5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The club-stemmed Boletus is so closely related to the edible Boletus
and so closely connected by the intermediate forms that it seems to be
only a variety of it, but one worthy of illustration. It differs in the
more uniform color of the cap, in having the tubes less depressed
around the stem and less tinted with green when mature, and in having
the stem more club-shape and commonly reticulated to the base. The
lower reticulations are usually coarser but less permanent than the upper.
The cap is more highly colored when young and is apt to become
paler with age, but the margin does not become paler than the central
part, as it so often does in the edible Boletus. Individuals sometimes
occur in which the stem is nearly cylindric and reticulated only on the
upper part. These connect so closely with the edible Boletus that we
have considered this to be a mere variety of it. In size and in edible
qualities it is very similar to that species. <cite>Peck</cite>, 51st Rep. N.Y. State

<p class='c000'>The Related boletus belongs to the
tribe of Boleti known as Edules because
of their especially esculent character, but it differs from the general
character of the tribe in having its tubes not at all or but slightly
shortened around the stem and in its stem not being thickened or bulbous
at the base. The species is quite variable in the color of the cap,
which is generally darker in young plants, paler in old ones. It may
be brown, reddish-brown or blackish-brown when young, but is more or
less tinged with tawny or ochraceous when old. It is smooth and even
or minutely tomentose and sometimes slightly rugose. In wet weather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>the margin of the cap sometimes curves upward, giving a very convex
surface to the tubes. Sometimes the wounded flesh slowly assumes a
yellowish hue. The peculiar rusty-ochraceous hue of the spores is also
seen sometimes in the tubes of old specimens. As in many species, the
flesh of old plants is more soft than that of young ones. The stem is
quite variable and is often narrowed downward. It is sometimes very
obscurely reticulated at the top.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cap is generally 2–4 in. broad, the stem 1.5–3 in. long, 4–8 lines
thick. The plants are found in thin woods or in bushy places in July
and August.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>maculo´sus</em> Pk. differs from the type simply in having a few
yellowish spots scattered over the cap.</p>

<p class='c000'>The deeply cracked surface of the pileus is the most notable feature
of this species. This sometimes is seen even in quite young plants.
The cracked areas are quite unequal in size. The deep chinks with
sloping sides cause them to appear like frusta of polygonal pyramids.

<p class='c000'>All authors, up to this date, agree in stating that the species within
this series are poisonous. Experiments made by Smiedeberg and
Koppe with Boletus Satanus developed symptoms closely resembling
poisoning by Amanitæ. Kobert, who made analysis of B. luridus,
shows that it contains muscarine, which is one of the most deadly poisons.
Such a mass of evidence commands respect. It is urged upon finders
of these species to either leave them alone or test them in minute
quantities until they have established their ability to eat them without
injury.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have taken special pains to establish the edibility of B. Satanus and
B. luridus. For fifteen years I have eaten them in quantity when
opportunity afforded, in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
My family, and my friends in widely separated localities, have partaken
freely of them many times and without discomfort. They are remarkably
fine eating. The same can be said of B. alveolatus, B. purpureus,
B. subvelutipes. I have not seen the other species of this tribe.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have determined so many of the reputed poisonous species to be
edible, that unless positively authenticated, I do not accept repute as
truth, but carefully test suspicious species upon myself. When sure
there is no danger, I as carefully have them tested by my numerous
under-tasters—male and female.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boletus Satanus is sometimes plentiful in spots. Where it luxuriates
it is a rich decoration to the ground, and earth upon upturned-roots

It is not as clannish, though occasionally three or four are found growing

<p class='c000'>Woods, swamps and open places.
Very common and appearing through
summer and autumn.</p>

<p class='c000'>This may fairly be called our most
common and variable species. It is
recorded in nearly every local list of
fungi. The pileus is convex, hemispherical
or even subconical. It may be
glabrous, minutely tomentose, subvelvety
or squamulose. The flesh is white
or whitish and sometimes slightly changeable
where wounded. The tubes are generally
rather long and with a rounded or
convex surface. The stem is distinctly
scabrous or roughened with small blackish-brown
or reddish dots or scales, the
ground color generally being whitish,
grayish or pallid.  The spores have
been described as pale-brown and light-yellowish.
When caught in a mass on white paper they appear
to me to approach snuff-brown. The viscidity of the pileus is not
always clearly discernible. Indeed the pileus is often quite as <em>dry as in</em>
B. versipellis. When moistened by heavy rains it sometimes is smooth
and clammy to the touch but scarcely viscid. Several varieties have
been indicated which are expressive of the variations in the color of the
pileus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>testa´ceus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> brick-red.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>auranti´acus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> orange or orange-red.</p>

<p class='c000'>These appear to connect this species and B. versipellis.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>aluta´ceus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> yellowish-tan color.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>fuligin´eus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> fuliginous or cinereous-fuliginous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>fus´cus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> brown or dark-brown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>oliva´ceus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> olivaceous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>ni´veus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> white, when old sometimes stained with blue or
livid-blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these might be added:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>Var. <em>areola´tus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> rimose-areolate. (Plate <a href='#plate118'>CXVIII</a>, fig. 4,
p. 436.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>mutab´ilis</em>. <strong>Flesh</strong> changing slightly to brown or pinkish where
wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>graci´lipes</em>. <strong>Stem</strong> very slender, 2–3 in. long, 2–3 lines thick.
<strong>Pileus</strong> thin, translucent when held toward the light.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Boletus is classed among the edible species, but it is said to be
less agreeable than B. edulis. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>West Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, <cite>McIlvaine</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The numerous varieties with their peculiarities here given by Professor
Peck will enable the finder of a Boletus with a distinctly scabrous stem—<em>roughened
with scales, not reticulate</em>—to select its name. For the
mycophagist it is enough to know that he has Boletus scaber. In all of
its varieties it is edible. The stems, often the tubes, unless young,
should be discarded, as they do not cook in the same time as the caps.
The comparative excellence of the species rests with the devourer. It
deserves a high place.</p>

<p class='c000'>B. scaber, var. areolatus, Plate <a href='#plate118'>CXVIII</a>, fig. 4, has slight flavor,
but is of pleasing consistency.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. durius´culus</strong> Schulz—somewhat hard. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2–5 in. across,
hemispherical, minutely velvety, viscid when moist, varying in color
from pale-brown, through dingy-chestnut, to umber-brown, often becoming
cracked in areas when dry, interstices paler. <strong>Flesh</strong> thick, white
or tinged yellow, when cut becoming reddish copper-color. <strong>Tubes</strong> ½-¾
in. long, shortened round the stem and free, openings about ⅔ mm.
across, often compound, irregularly angular, bright-yellow. <strong>Stem</strong> 4–7
in. long, fusiform, thickest part 1½-2 in. across, situated below the
middle, yellowish, rough with blackish points, which are sometimes arranged
in a subreticulate manner, apex sometimes more or less grooved,
solid, flesh of upper part becoming coppery like the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong>
elongato-cylindrical, pale-umber, 14–16×5–6µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>In woods. Esculent and very delicious. Allied to Boletus scaber,
but distinguished by the bright-yellow tubes and the very firm flesh,
which turns coppery-red when exposed to the air; this color eventually
changes to a dingy grayish-violet. Also allied to Boletus porphyrosporus.

<p class='c000'>This is closely related to B. scaber, of which it may possibly prove
to be a dwarf form; but it is easily distinguished by its smooth or only
slightly scurfy and subbulbous stem. It presents no appearance of the
colored dot-like squamules which are a constant and characteristic
feature of that species. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>West Virginia. Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia. <cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Specimens found at Mt. Gretna, Pa., had a satiny, glossy stem,
beautifully furfuraceous, and stem <em>not</em> thickened at base. Professor
Peck, to whom specimens were sent, writes: “Stem is a little more
furfuraceous, and not thickened at the base, otherwise the agreement is
very good.” It is good fried.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. chro´mapes</strong> Frost. <strong>Pileus</strong> convex or nearly plane, slightly and
sometimes fasciculately tomentose, pale-red. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, unchangeable.
<strong>Tubes</strong> subadnate, more or less depressed around the stem, white or
whitish, becoming brown. <strong>Stem</strong> equal or slightly tapering upward,
<em>rough-spotted</em>, whitish or pallid, <em>chrome-yellow at the base both without
and within</em>, sometimes reddish above. <strong>Spores</strong> oblong, 12–14×4–5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 2–4 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 2–4 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods. New England, <cite>Frost</cite>; New York, <cite>Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The yellow base of the stem appears to be a peculiar and constant
character by which the species may easily be recognized. It imitates
Boletus piperatus in this respect, but in everything else it is very distinct
from that plant. Sometimes the stem is so badly infested by
larvæ that it is difficult to procure a sound specimen. The spores have
a subferruginous color with a slight incarnate tint, but the rough-dotted
stem indicates a relationship with B. scaber. Through this species, Boletus
conicus and B. gracilis, the Versipelles and the Hyporhodii appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>to run together. In the Catalogue of Plants of Amherst the specific
name is “chromapus.” It would be more in accordance with
present custom to write it “chromopus.” <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>A dozen or more specimens referable to this species were found by
me at Mt. Gretna, Pa., August, 1897, in mixed woods. The caps were
eaten and were excellent.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. nebulo´sus</strong> Pk. <strong>Pileus</strong> convex, dry, snuff-brown or smoky-brown.
<strong>Flesh</strong> white, unchangeable. <strong>Tubes</strong> convex, depressed around the stem,

<p class='c000'>By a painting made by the writer September, 1885, Professor Peck
identified the species of which it is a picture as B. nebulosus Pk. The
following notes accompany it, which have been verified many times
since their writing:</p>

<p class='c000'>Oak woods. West Philadelphia, Pa., September. Mt. Gretna, Pa.,
September.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> chestnut-brown and darker, covered with small, low, black
spots; convex, often depressed in center, sharp on margin. <strong>Flesh</strong>
white, thick, solid, unchangeable. <strong>Tubes</strong> very small, and light pinkish-brown.
When touched they change to a deeper hue. <strong>Stem</strong> same
color as pileus, but a shade lighter, solid, scurfy, having a striate appearance,
enlarging toward base.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taste sweet and pleasant. Cooked it is juicy, meaty and very fine.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. ful´vus Pk</strong>.—brownish-yellow.  (Plate <a href='#plate116'>CXVI</a>, fig. 3, p. 420.)
<strong>Pileus</strong> thick, convex or subcampanulate, dry, glabrous, rimose-areolate,
tawny-yellow, the extreme margin dark-brown. <strong>Flesh</strong> spongy, tough,
white, slowly assuming a reddish tint upon exposure to the air. <strong>Tubes</strong>
rather long, ventricose, depressed around the stem and free or nearly
so, greenish-yellow, the mouths small, tawny-yellow. <strong>Stem</strong> rather long,
often narrowed and striate at the top, dotted with brownish-orange granules
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>or points, radicating, tough, stuffed with greenish-yellow fibers,
colored like the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 2–3 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 4–5 in. long, 4–8 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cespitose on decaying stumps. West Philadelphia, Pa. August.
<cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. McIlvaine says that there were between twenty and thirty specimens
on and about an old stump and that they were as attractive to the
eye as a cluster of Clitocybe illudens. <cite>Peck</cite>, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol.
27, January, 1900.</p>

<p class='c000'>Excellent in flavor, rather spongy, but fine.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Hyporho´dii.</span> <i>Gr</i>—somewhat rose-colored.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Tubes</strong> adnate to the stem, whitish, then white-incarnate from the
rosy spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this tribe the tubes are at first whitish, but with the development
of the spores they usually assume a pinkish or flesh-colored hue.
Wounds of the tubes in some species cause a change in color but not to
blue, nor are the tube mouths differently colored as in the Luridi. The
stem in some is more or less reticulated but this is scarcely a constant
or reliable character in these species. Typically the spores are rosy or
flesh-colored, but I have admitted species in which they incline to rust-colored,
giving more weight to the color of the tubes than to that of
the spores.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. con´icus</strong> Rav.—conical. <strong>Pileus</strong> convex or <em>subconical</em>, clothed

<p class='c000'>The species is compared to Boletus scaber, from which it differs in its
smaller tubes and smooth stem, and from both this and B. albellus it
differs in the color of the tubes and in the yellowish flocci of the pileus.
I have seen no specimens, but on account of the color of the tubes I
have placed the species with the Hyporhodii. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. gra´cilis</strong> Pk.—slender. (Plate <a href='#plate114'>CXIV</a>, fig. 1, p. 414.) <strong>Pileus</strong>
convex, glabrous or minutely tomentose, rarely squamulose, ochraceous-brown,
tawny-brown or reddish-brown. <strong>Flesh</strong> white. <strong>Tubes</strong> plane or
convex, depressed around the stem, nearly free, whitish, becoming pale
flesh-colored, their mouths subrotund. <strong>Stem</strong> <em>long, slender</em>, equal or
slightly tapering upward, pruinose or minutely branny, even or marked
by slender elevated anastomosing lines which form long narrow reticulations.
<strong>Spores</strong> subferruginous, 12.5–17.5×5–6µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods. New York, <cite>Peck</cite>; New England, <cite>Frost</cite>; Ohio, <cite>Morgan</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The slender habit separates this species from all the others here included
in this tribe. Its spores are not a clear incarnate in color, but
incline to dull-ferruginous, and by this character this and the preceding
species connect this tribe with Versipelles. In color B. gracilis resembles
some forms of B. felleus, but in size, habit and color of spores it
is easily distinct. The tomentum of the pileus sometimes breaks into
tufts or squamules. This is Boletus vinaceus, Frost MS. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti
of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>B. gracilis, var. lævipes, was found by the writer in Woodland Cemetery,
West Philadelphia, August, 1897, and at Mt. Gretna, Pa., September,
1898. The stem of some specimens spreads at the top. The
pileus is often cracked on the margin, and the upturning of the margin
often exposes the tubes. Painting, as of this species, identified by
Professor Peck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The taste is at first sweet, then bitter. The bitterness is lost in cooking.
Edible, good.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span><strong>B. indeci´sus</strong> Pk.—undecided. (Plate <a href='#plate122'>CXXII</a>, fig. 1, p. 468.) <strong>Pileus</strong>
convex or nearly plane, dry, slightly tomentose, ochraceous-brown,
often wavy or irregular on the margin. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, unchangeable;
taste mild. <strong>Tubes</strong> nearly plane or convex, <em>adnate</em>, grayish becoming
tinged with flesh color when mature, changing to brownish where
wounded, their mouths small, subrotund. <strong>Stem</strong> minutely furfuraceous,
straight, or flexuous, <em>reticulated above</em>, pallid without and within.
<strong>Spores</strong> oblong, <em>brownish flesh color</em>, 12.5–15×4µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thin oak woods. New York, <cite>Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mild taste and darker colored spores will separate this Boletus
from any form of B. felleus. Its stem reticulated above distinguishes it
from B. alutarius. It resembles B. modestus in some respects, but its
tubes are not at all yellow. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

N.J., August, 1897, <cite>Sterling</cite>. In open mixed woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boletus indecisus so closely resembles B. felleus in some of its forms
that until the color of the spores is ascertained, the sweet taste, without
trace of bitter, is the only thing that will enable the finder to discriminate
between them. Young B. felleus are at first pleasant to the taste
and do not, at once, develop their intense bitter in the mouth. They
may readily be taken for B. indecisus. If, by mistake, a single B. felleus
is cooked with mild species, the dish will be spoiled. Specimens believed
to be B. indecisus should be tested. A minute will perfectly satisfy
anyone.</p>

<p class='c000'>The B. indecisus is delicious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Common in West Virginia mountains where it grows with B. felleus,
from which it is impossible to distinguish it without tasting. It is delicious
when cooked. But I long ago ceased collecting for the table
any Boletus questionable for B. felleus. I have been deceived so many
times—taken the bitter for the sweet—that, preferring the sweet, I take
no chances for the bitter.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. fel´leus</strong> Bull.—<em>fel</em>, gall. Bitter. (Plate <a href='#plate122'>CXXII</a>, fig. 2, 3, 4,
p. 468.) <strong>Pileus</strong> convex or nearly plane, firm, becoming soft, <em>glabrous</em>,
even, variable in color, pale-yellowish, grayish-brown, yellowish-brown,
reddish-brown or chestnut. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, often changing to flesh color
where wounded, taste <em>bitter</em>. <strong>Tubes</strong> adnate, long, convex, depressed
around the stem, their mouths angular, white, becoming tinged with
flesh-color. <strong>Stem</strong> variable, equal or tapering upward, short or long,
sometimes bulbous or enlarged at the base, subglabrous, generally
reticulated above, colored like or a little paler than the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong>
oblong-fusiform, flesh-colored, 12.5–17.5×4–5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>obe´sus</em>. <strong>Pileus</strong> large. <strong>Stem</strong> thick, coarsely and distinctly
reticulated nearly or quite to the base.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 3–8 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 2–4 in. long, 6–12 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>The variety is large and solitary in its mode of growth. It is remarkable
for the coarse reticulations of the stem which extend nearly or quite
to the base. After heavy rains the pileus is viscid. It may prove to
be a distinct species.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flesh in the American plant does not always assume incarnate
hues where wounded. The color of the fresh tubes often changes to a
deeper tint where wounded. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, <cite>McIlvaine</cite>;
Indiana, <cite>H.I. Miller</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very common species in woods and on thin margins, on open
grassy places, and about decayed stumps. I saw hundreds of plants,
var. obesus, some a foot in diameter, in a wheat stubble near oak
woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most attractive of Boleti. Its cap resembles a handsomely
browned cake. Its solidity is inviting; its flesh, generous in quantity,
excites appetite. Until one experiences its intense lasting bitter, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>clings to it with hope. Even after tasting, it is thrown away with
regret. It is not poisonous, but a small piece of one will embitter a
whole dish. <cite>McIlvaine</cite>, Bull. Phila. Myc. Center. July, 1898.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. nigrel´lus</strong> Pk.—blackish. <strong>Pileus</strong> broadly convex or nearly plane,
dry, subglabrous, <em>blackish</em>. <strong>Flesh</strong> soft, white, unchangeable. <strong>Tubes</strong>
plane or convex, adnate, sometimes slightly depressed around the stem,
their mouths small, subrotund, whitish becoming flesh-colored, slowly
changing to <em>brown or blackish where wounded</em>. <strong>Stem</strong> equal, short,
<em>even</em>, colored like or a little paler than the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> dull flesh-colored,
10–12×5–6µ.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 3–6 in. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 1.5–2.5 in. long, 6–12 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods and copses. New York, <cite>Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blackish color of the pileus and stem distinguishes this species.

<p class='c000'>Another distinguishing mark from B. alboater is the velvety pileus of
the latter. B. nigrellus is mild in taste and smell and an excellent
species for the table.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>B. eccen´tricus</strong> Pk.—eccentric. (Plate <a href='#plate116'>CXVI</a>, fig. 1, p. 420.)
<strong>Pileus</strong> thick, firm, convex, irregular, glabrous, more or less lobed or
wavy on the involute margin, gray or yellowish-gray. <strong>Flesh</strong> white,
close-grained, elastic, unchangeable, taste and odor farinaceous. <strong>Tubes</strong>
convex, depressed around the stem, not reaching the margin of the pileus,
somewhat uneven and pitted on the surface, yellowish-brown, the
mouths subangular, at first concolorous, becoming reddish or reddish-purple.
<strong>Stem</strong> eccentric, tapering downward, solid, uneven with short
irregular shallow grooves or obscure reticulations, tinged with red at the
top, grayish below, tinged with red or purple within at the base.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pileus</strong> 5–10 cm. broad. <strong>Stem</strong> 4–5 cm. long, 3–4 cm. thick at the top.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sandy soil in grassy places in woods. Mt. Gretna, Pa. August and
September.</p>

<p class='c000'>The species is well marked by its eccentric stem, thick irregular pileus
and the reddish or reddish-purple mouths of the mature tubes. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>McIlvaine remarks that when it is cooked it is delicate and savory.
<cite>Peck</cite>, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, No. 27.</p>

<p class='c000'>In commenting upon this new species to the writer, Professor Peck
says: “I suspect that the spores of this (B. eccentricus) are pinkish
or rosy. If so, it belongs here (in Hyporhodii). If not, it may have
to go in the Luridi, or possibly may be made the type of a new tribe.”</p>

<h5 class='c029'><span class='sc'>Cario´si</span>—<em>caries</em>, rottenness.</h5>

<p class='c026'>Stem never reticulated, stuffed with a spongy pith, at length commonly
excavated. Tubes at first white, then often yellowish, their
mouths minute, round.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fries adds to these characters, “spores white.” But in our species
the spores are pale-yellow when shed in a mass on white paper. They
are more elliptical in outline than the spores of most Boleti. The
character of the stem is peculiar and easily distinguishes the tribe. The
exterior is firm, the interior soft and spongy, becoming irregularly
hollow or cavernous in the typical species.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boletus castaneus is one of the neatest looking of fungi. The prevailing
color is cinnamon, that of the tubes white or very light yellow,
spotted with brown wherever insects have touched them. The pore
surface of mature specimens is usually irregular. Whoever has seen
the stalagmites of Luray Cave will recognize their color on the stems of
B. castaneus. These are brittle, snapping like pipe stems, with a small
tube in center.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fungus is common from June until September. It is gregarious,
occasionally three or four individuals form a group. Either raw or

<p class='c017'><strong>B. radico´sus</strong> Bundy. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin, wide, recurved, yellow tinged
with brown, the cuticle easily removed. <strong>Flesh</strong> pale-yellowish tinged
with pink, not changing color when bruised. <strong>Tubes</strong> decurrent, large,
uneven-mouthed, compound, angular, tinged with brown. <strong>Stem</strong> flexuous,

<p class='c017'><strong>S. strobila´ceus</strong> Berk. <i>Gr</i>—cone-like. (Plate <a href='#plate124'>CXXIV</a>.) <strong>Pileus</strong>
hemispherical or convex, dry, covered with thick floccose projecting
blackish or blackish-brown scales, the margin somewhat appendiculate
with scales and fragments of the veil. <strong>Flesh</strong> whitish, changing to
reddish and then to blackish where wounded. <strong>Tubes</strong> adnate, whitish,
becoming brown or blackish with age; their mouths large, angular,
changing color like the flesh. <strong>Stem</strong> equal or tapering upward, sulcate
at the top, floccose-tomentose, colored like the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> subglobose,
rough, blackish-brown, 10–12.5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>West Virginia mountains, Pennsylvania, <cite>McIlvaine</cite>; Indiana, <cite>H.I.
Miller</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Common in woods and their margins, under the overhanging sods of
washes and road-cuts. Often in troops, occasionally cespitose. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>rough fuzzy cap reminds of short fur that has been wet and dried. Its
appearance is unique among Boleti. Before cooking the stem and tubes
should be removed, unless the latter are very firm and fresh. The
squamules must be cut away or the dish will be rough.</p>

<p class='c000'>With many this Boletus is a prime favorite. It has a strong woody
taste, sometimes musky, sometimes faintly of anisette. It cooks well
by any method.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>S. floc´copus</strong> Vahl.—floccose-stemmed. <strong>Pileus</strong> convex, soft, covered
with areas of bunched rough, scaly tomentum, cinereous, at
length blackish, appendiculate with the silky, thick annular veil. <strong>Tubes</strong>
<em>shortened behind</em>, their mouths large, whitish-gray. <strong>Stem</strong> stout, pitted
above, umber-tomentose below. <strong>Spores</strong> perfectly globose, brown, 9µ
broad.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woods. North Carolina and Pennsylvania, <cite>Schweinitz</cite>; Ohio, <cite>Morgan</cite>;
New York, <cite>Peck</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to Fries this is a larger and firmer species than S. strobilaceus
but manifestly related to it. The New York specimens which
I have referred to it differ from S. strobilaceus in no respect, except in
the tubes being depressed around the stem. Unless there are other
differences in the European plant, it scarcely seems to me to be worthy
of specific distinction. Boletus floccopus, Rost. tab. 40, is referred to
Boletus scaber, as is B. holopus, Rost. tab. 48. <cite>Peck</cite>, Boleti of the
U.S.</p>

<p class='c000'>I agree with Professor Peck that this species is not worthy of specific
distinction. During 1898 I found a bunch containing eight individuals
which varied through all botanic characteristics given to both species.
The largest individual was 4½ in. across cap, the smallest 1½ in. On
some the tubes were adnate, on others shortened behind. There was
no difference in flavor excepting that due to age.</p>

<p class='c000'>Small specimens may be confounded with F. pallida, which follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fistulina hepatica is celebrated in most countries, and known usually
as the Beefsteak fungus. It grows from decaying crevices in oak, chestnut
and other trees and stumps, but those named are its favorites. July,
August, September are its months, and after rains. In some localities
and years it is rare. At Mt. Gretna, in 1898, a hundred pounds of it
could be gathered almost any day.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>August, 1899, at Mt. Gretna, Pa., I found several specimens in vicinity
which, though evidently F. hepatica, were remarkable for their
structure—2–4 in. across, irregularly cylindrical, with spore surface
covering the entire fungus. Stem curt, eccentric, almost central.
Specimens were sent Professor Peck, who writes:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The sample of Fistulina which you send is a singular thing. Saccardo
has noted a somewhat similar form but without pore surface.
Yours has pore surface, but I do not find spores developed in it. I am
inclined to think it a monstrosity, as you do, but as you say you have
found several of them I think it would be well to put it on record and I
will enter it in my record as Fistulina hepatica monstrosa n. var. and
indicate its characters.” Letter from Professor Peck, August 28, 1899.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have partially succeeded in transplanting the mycelium of F.
hepatica. Experiments in this direction, I feel confident, will introduce
this valuable fungus to localities where it is not now found, or is rare.
Experiments with the spores have not been as yet successful.</p>

margin which frequently is bright rose color, sometimes yellowish-rose.
It is rather tasteless—slightly woody in flavor, rather tough. An emergency
species.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>FAMILY III.—<strong>HYDNA´CEÆ.</strong></h3>
</div>

<p class='c026'><strong>Hymenium</strong> inferior or amphigenous (not confined to one surface),
from the first definitely protuberant, spread over persistent spines,
bristles, teeth, tubercles or papilla. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>While the highest members of this family possess the general form of
the mushroom, others, lacking a stem, recline on the back (resupinate);
the lowest, without even the appearance of a distinct pileus,
seem to be simply spread over the supporting body (effused). In the
highest class the spines or other spore-bearing surface are inferior, <em>i. e.</em>,
below the pileus; in the others they are of course superior, <em>i. e.</em>, above
the pileus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the eleven genera but two contain species of food value. Hydnum,
characterized by its acute spines, embraces species which are
eaten as delicacies, and Irpex, distinguished by its somewhat acute
teeth growing from a ridgy hymenium, contains those which may furnish
sustenance in time of need. In Caldesia, bearing spines, the texture is
floccose not fleshy. Sistotrema has a pileus and a central stem, but instead
of spines bears irregular flattened teeth. The remaining genera
are separated by the tubercles, granules, folds, etc., which take the
place of spines or teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several species of Hydnum are common to earth and wood, others
are distinct in their habitats.</p>

    <div>A harrow.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Hymenium inferior, toothed from the first. Teeth firm, somewhat
coriaceous, acute, concrete with the pileus, arranged in rows or like
network, connected at the base by folds, which are gill-like (in sessile
species) or resemble honeycomb (in resupinate ones). Sporophores
4-spored. Growing on wood, somewhat growing from the side or upon
the back, approaching Lenzites and Dædaleæ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Irpex differs from Hydnum in having the spines connected at the
base, and in their being less awl-shaped and pointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is reported as found well up in the northern States, but its species
prefer warm climates. Irpex contains no choice species, but all I have
tested can be eaten.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>I. obli´quus</strong> Fr.—oblique. White, inclining to pale, effused (spread),
forming an adnate crust, circumference flaxy. Teeth <em>extended from a
base resembling honeycomb, compressed, unequal, incised</em>, oblique, 2–3
lines long.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first abundantly porous, but toothed from the first, at length quite
as in Hydna.</p>

<p class='c000'>On stumps and dead branches. November to February. <cite>Stevenson.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>This spreads in irregular patches on the surface of decaying wood.
The pores for a small space round the margin are round and distinct,
but toward the center are greatly lengthened out, lying one upon another
in an imbricated manner. The color is white at first, when old it
changes to a yellow-brown, and at last to a dirty fuscous black. <cite>Bolton.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>At first it looks more like a small white orbicular resupinate Polyporus
than an Irpex. <cite>Peck.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>The species is common and can be collected at most times of the
year. When fresh and moist it can be shaved from its host plant.
Goodly quantities can thus be obtained. It stews to a firm gelatinous
mass of pleasant flavor. The lost hunter need not die of starvation in
any woods if he will but study the tree-growing fungi, and especially
the small species, hitherto insignificant in food circles.</p>

pubescent, somewhat flaxy. Teeth <em>extended in awl-shape
from a minutely porous base, thin</em>, somewhat digitato-incised (cut in
finger-shape), 1–2 lines long. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>It approaches the Polypori. Grows on wood. <cite>Stevenson.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>North Carolina, <cite>Schweinitz</cite>, <cite>Curtis</cite>; Massachusetts, <cite>Frost</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Common on stumps and trees. The awl-shaped teeth, which have
the appearance of shreds, can be scraped from the fresh plant, or if
dried plants are moistened, the teeth are detachable, and are food-giving.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>I. fusco-vioia´ceus</b> Fr.—<em>fuscus</em>, brown; <em>violaceous</em>, violet. <strong>Pileus</strong>
2 in. long, more than 1 in. broad, <em>white inclining to hoary</em>, effuso-reflexed,

<p class='c000'>Our specimens are not “silky,” as required by the description, but
villose or tomentose-villose as in Polyporus hirsutus and P. abietinus,
the latter of which this species closely resembles. The hymenium,
however, is coarser, more highly colored and lamellated to such an
extent that young specimens might easily be taken for a Lenzites.

<p class='c000'>This, the only genus of Thelephoraceæ containing edible fungi, has
the form and general appearance of Cantharellus to which it is allied,

The species vary from fleshy to membranaceous, all having a funnel-shaped
pileus and stem merging into it. On the ground. Autumn.
The slightly veined surface where the spores are borne, and the spores
themselves, when a microscope is brought to bear upon them, distinguish
this genus from Cantharellus; and its thin flesh and funnel-shape
from the large forms of Pistillaria. Several of the species are edible.

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span><strong>C. cornucopoi´des</strong> Pers.—<em>cornu</em> and <em>copiæ</em>, horn of plenty. (Plate
<a href='#plate136'>CXXXVI</a>, fig. 8, p. 508.) <strong>Cap</strong> dark sooty shades of gray or brown—shades
of well-worn velveteen—1–2 in. across, whole plant from 2–4
in. high, trumpet-shaped, or like a funnel with its open mouth, plane,
wavy, split or in folds. Substance very thin and either brittle or tough.
The inside is sometimes minutely scaly, the opening extending to the
base; outside, where the spores are borne, it has neither gills, pores nor
protuberances, but a slightly uneven surface varying little in color.
<strong>Stem</strong> obsolete or seldom noticeable. <strong>Odor</strong> slight.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> pointed, 11–12×7–8µ <cite>Massee</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grows single, clustered or in troops along shaded roads, or from leaf
mold and ground in woods. July to frost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Large patches, clustered, grow near stumps in moist places on Botanic
Creek, West Philadelphia. It is plentiful near Haddonfield, N.
J., at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and many other places in the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not pleasant to look upon, because of its peculiar color, but
when one gets used to it it has an attractiveness of its own. Its graceful
shape, even its funereal hue and name—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trompet du Morte</span>—are alluring.</p>

<p class='c000'>It dries well, and when moistened expands to its normal size. It is
a first-class edible fungus. It should be stewed slowly until tender.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. clava´tus</strong> Fr.—<em>clava</em>, a club. <strong>Pileus</strong> 2 in. broad, somewhat light-yellowish,
fleshy, <em>top-shape, truncate</em> or depressed, flexuous, unpolished,

then corrugated, purplish then changing color. <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Spores</strong> elliptical, pale-yellow, 10–12×4–5µ <cite>Massee</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck notes that the species so closely resembles Cantharellus
cibarius that it might easily be mistaken for a deformed condition of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ground under spruce trees. Adirondack mountains. August.</p>

<p class='c000'>In color this species bears some resemblance to Cantharellus cinereus.
From Craterellus sinuosus it is separated by its pervious stem, and from
C. cornucopoides by its more cespitose habit, paler color and smaller
spores. <cite>Peck</cite>, 31st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

downy, grayish-brown, margin undulated. <strong>Stem</strong> pale yellow,
elongated, stuffed. <strong>Hymenium</strong> with anastomosing ribs, grayish.
<strong>Spores</strong> elliptical, pale yellow, 8–9×5µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>In woods. <strong>Pileus</strong> ½-1 in. high and broad. <strong>Stem</strong> about 1 in. high,
sometimes very short. <strong>Smell</strong> strong, musky. <strong>Hymenium</strong> becoming
tan-color when dry. <strong>Pileus</strong> more or less villose. <cite>Massee.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>The above description is given so that Var. crispus which follows

<p class='c000'>But three genera—Clavaria, Sparassis and Pistillaria—include species
of food value. They are easily recognized.</p>

<p class='c000'>The genus Calcocera resembles Clavaria in form, but is very different
in material, being a jelly-like viscid, cartilaginous substance, horny
when dry, resembling that of Tremella.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have seen it 2 ft. across. “Delicosissima.” <cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>A perfect specimen of S. crispa resembles a huge rosette, round and
many-folded in tortuous design. The folds are wide, flattened branches
springing from a common base, thin, semi-transparent, not unlike damp
sheets of gelatine although thicker. Surfaces of the leaves are dull, like
the flattened seaweeds and the light-colored sea-rock mosses. S. crispa
may be easily dried, and though shrinking much in size, retains its
shape, forming a very pretty ornament for the desk of the mycologist.
It is not common. Where it has chosen a habitat several tufts may be
found during the moderate season. The writer found three specimens
ranging from 6–12 in. in diameter near Haddonfield, N.J., others, not
as large, in West Virginia and in Chester county, Pa.</p>

<p class='c000'>Excepting to toadstool hunters the Clavaria, though numerous, are
not known to those who “Know a toadstool when they see it.” They
bear no semblance to the stereotyped toadstool. They seem to possess
an imitative faculty. Those growing among grasses harmonize with
the faded stalks under debris or the bleached surfaces of blades famishing
for sunlight; those of the woods take on the color of the leaf mat or
of the lichens, and shapes of club and deer-horn mosses, or assemble in
groves as pigmy trees, boled and sturdy-branched in mimicry of their
giant protectors towering above them. In their forms many are delicate,
graceful, beautiful, others are intricate. There is fascination for
eye and brain in looking through the vistas and labyrinths of their
branches.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few species are tough as shoe-strings; a few bitter; one, C. dichotoma,
on the authority of Leuba, contains a minor poison. The genus
is plentiful and reliable. Many individuals are of marked excellence.
In soups, stews, patties, they remind one of noodles; sometimes of
macaroni. The hard parts of the stem should be removed, the branches
broken or cut in ½ in. lengths. If stewed, they require time and slow
cooking; if fried in butter they are crisp, choice bits.</p>

<p class='c000'>The C. flava and C. botrytes have long been noted edible species,

<p class='c000'>Plants for the table should be young and fresh. When aged or when

<p class='c000'>Excepting when young (not always then) the red tips to the branchlets

spot will, after a rain, grow pale, spindling, tender bunches,
having but a tinge of red upon the points; perhaps not any. A rich,
better lighted spot will produce more robust and highly colored plants.
The same can be said of C. flava. C. botrytes is plentiful in Pennsylvania,

<p class='c000'>The writer first found this truly club-like species in West Virginia in
1882, and ate it. But few specimens were found, and those of a dark
chocolate color. At Mount Gretna in 1897 and 1898 the yellow variety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>grew in considerable quantity from July until after frost. The
largest specimen found measured 5½ in. and was 1 in. in diameter at
its thickest part. The average height is 2½ in. Both varieties grew
in mixed woods from the leaf-covered ground. They are often clustered,
four or five together, and of different sizes. The surface, especially
of the dark variety, is regularly, vertically wrinkled, truncated in
few places, very much resembling that of the Craterellus cantharellus.
The stems of both are white. The apex of the clubs is folded inward
as though pulled by drawing-strings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flesh is soft, white, fine grained. A slight bitter is present in the
dark variety, when raw, which entirely disappears upon cooking. This
is one of the best of Clavariæ.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>C. clava´ta</strong> Pk. Simple, straight, clavate, obtuse, smooth, not hollow,
yellow when fresh, rugose-wrinkled and orange-colored when dry,
4–6 lines high.</p>

<p class='c000'>Damp shaded banks by road-sides. Sandlake. June. <cite>Peck</cite>, 25th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Patches of it are conspicuous—golden-hued upon somber background.
They are seen at Eagle’s Mere, Mt. Gretna, and on the
Springton Hills, Pa., along wooded road-sides. Raw, they have a mild,
pleasant flavor, and have the same when cooked. A small species seldom
found in sufficient quantity to make a comforting dish.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>FAMILY VI.—<strong>TREMELLA´CEÆ</strong> Fr.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Whole fungus homogeneous, gelatinous, shrivelling when dry, reviving
when moistened, pervaded internally with branched filaments,
terminating toward the surface all round in sporophores. Spores transparent,
from globose to sausage-shape and curved, sometimes septate.
<cite>Fries.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>The Tremellaceæ, as their name signifies, tremble, because jelly-like
when moist. They are hard, tough, horny when dry, but swell and
become gelatinous when wet. In the typical genus, Tremella, there is
often but little consistency. Whoever has climbed an old rail fence on
a rainy day has had the doubtful pleasure of acquaintance with some of
them. Sections for the microscope are obtainable by hardening them
in alcohol.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several edible species in the family. They are good in
soups, giving them flavor and body, and some are excellent when
stewed.</p>

<p class='c017'>The reproductive bodies consisting of sporidia mostly definite, contained
in asci—mother cells or sacs—springing from a naked or enclosed
stratum of fructifying cells and forming a hymenium or nucleus. The
sporidia are often accompanied by simple or branched threads, which
are abortive asci, called paraphyses.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Hymenomycetes the spores are entirely unenclosed and are borne
on stalk-like processes on the gills of Agaricaceæ, in the tubes of Polyporaceæ,
on the spines of Hydnaceæ, etc. In Ascomycetes they are
enclosed in sacs springing from the external layer of the fruit-bearing
surface, which may be on the outer surface of the plant or enclosed.</p>

<p class='c017'>Stipitate or subsessile. <strong>Pileus</strong> globose or ovate, adnate throughout
its length to the sides of the stem, remaining closed at the apex, hollow
and continuous with the cavity of the stem; externally furnished with
stout, branched and anastomosing ribs or plates, every part bearing the
hymenium. <strong>Stem</strong> stout, stuffed or hollow; asci cylindrical, 2–4–8-spored.
<strong>Spores</strong> 1-seriate, continuous, hyaline, elliptical; paraphyses
septate, clavate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most nearly allied to Gyromitra; differs in the ribs of the pileus being
deep and plate-like, and anastomosing to form elongated or irregularly
polygonal deep pits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Growing on the ground in the spring. <cite>Massee.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Stem stout; pileus ovoid or conical, deeply folded into pits, resembling
honeycomb.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding Dill, the author of the genus, describes the caps as
adnate throughout their length to the stem, such is not the case. Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>Peck arranges the genus into two groups, “in one of which the
margin of the cap is wholly attached to the stem, in the other it is
free.” In the latter group are M. bispora and M. semilibera.</p>

<p class='c000'>The species are so much alike that botanical descriptions are omitted
of all but M. esculenta and Professor Peck’s species.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not one of the Morells is even suspicious. They are favorites wherever
found. The Morell is one of the few species known to the settler
and to the farmer. It loves old apple orchards, probably because ashes
have been used about the trees; ashes and cinders are its choice fertilizers.
In Germany peasants formerly burned forests to insure a bountiful
crop. Mr. Moore, of San Francisco, Cal., says: “We find it in
profusion on burnt hillsides all along the Pacific coast.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But it does not confine its habitat to burned surfaces. It grows in
thin open woods or on borders of woods. It grows under pine, ash,
oaks and other trees. Strange to say it grows under the walnut tree
where very few fungi of any kind grow. Especially does it love the
white walnut or butternut.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>M. esculen´ta</strong> Pers.—esculent. (Plate <a href='#plate046'>XLVI</a>, fig. 2, p. 214.) <strong>Pileus</strong>

stout, forming irregular, polygonal, deep pits, pale dingy yellow, buff
or tawny, 1.25–2.5 in. high and broad. <strong>Stem</strong> stout, whitish, almost
even, hollow or stuffed, 1.25–2.5 in. high, .8 in. and more thick; asci
cylindrical, 8-spored. <strong>Spores</strong> continuous, smooth, hyaline, elliptical,

<p class='c000'>The common Morell varies in size, 2–4 in. high, sometimes larger.
The cap, usually broader than it is long, oval, at times tapering to a
rounded top. The cavities resemble those of a weather-beaten honeycomb,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>and are whitish, or grayish or brownish. The stem is about ½
in. in diameter. It is an easily recognized species. Edible. Choice.

<p class='c017'><strong>M. cras´sipes</strong> Pers.—<em>crassus</em>, thick; <em>pes</em>, a foot. Agreeing with M.
esculenta in having the pits of the pileus irregular in form, not much,
if at all, longer than broad, and in not having a main series of more or
less parallel and vertical ribs; differing in the stout stem being much
longer than the pileus. <cite>Massee.</cite></p>

<p class='c017'><strong>M. delicio´sa</strong> Fr. The Delicious morell is easily known by the shape
of its cap, which is cylindrical or nearly so. Sometimes it is slightly
narrowed toward the top and occasionally curved, as in the preceding
species, but its long narrow shape and blunt apex is quite strongly contrasted
with that species. It is usually two or three times as long as it
is broad, and generally it is longer than the stem. Specimens also occur
in which the cap is slightly more narrow in the middle than it is
above and below, and rarely it is slightly pointed at the apex. The
pits on its surface are rather narrow and mostly longer than broad. The
stem is often rather short.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plant varies from 1½-3 in. high. <cite>Peck</cite>, 48th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its name gives it esculent properties.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>M. con´ica</strong> Pers.—conical. The Conical morell has the cap conical
or oblong-conical, as its name indicates. The longitudinal ridges on
its surface run more regularly from top to base than in the Common
morell. They are connected by short transverse ridges which are so
distant from each other or so incomplete that the resulting pits or depressions
are generally longer than broad, and sometimes rather irregular.
The color in the young plant is a beautiful buff-yellow or very
pale ochraceous, but it becomes darker with age.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plants are generally 3–5 in. high, with the cap 1½-2 in. thick
in its broadest part, and distinctly broader than the stem. <cite>Peck</cite>, 48th

Virginia, <cite>McIlvaine</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conical form distinguishes M. conica from M. esculenta, if they
are really different species, as some writers doubt. For the table there
is not any difference.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>M. bi´spora</strong> Sor.—Two-spored. The Two-spored morell is very similar
to the Half-free morell in external appearance. It is distinguishable
by its cap, which is free from the stem almost or quite to the top. The
stem of the European plant has been described as stuffed, but in our
plant it is hollow, though possibly in very young plants it may be
stuffed. The remarkable and very distinctive character which gives
name to the species can only be seen by the aid of a microscope. In
this species there are only two spores in each ascus or sack and these
are much larger than the spores of the other species. They are two or
three times longer and sometimes slightly curved. The spores of the
other species are eight in an ascus and are very much alike in size and
shape, and do not furnish decided specific characters; but in this species
their importance can not be overlooked. Their length is about 60µ,
while in the others it is 20–25µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is probably our rarest species. I am not aware that it has been
found in but one locality in our state. A few years ago Mr. H.A.
Warne detected it growing among fallen leaves in a ravine near Oneida.
I have not tested its edible qualities, but would have no hesitation in

<p class='c000'>Two forms occur, one with the pileus oblong-conical, rather obtuse,
often tipped with a slight umbo or papilla, and with a diameter a little
surpassing that of the stem from which the base is separated by a slight
groove; the other with the pileus narrowly conical, rather acute,
scarcely exceeding the stem in diameter and without any separating
groove. The stem and fruit are alike in both forms. The stem is
usually about equal in length to the pileus. The species is related to
M. conica and M. elata, but may be separated from both by the size of
the spores and the character of the paraphyses. In our plant I have
never seen these as long as the asci. Large forms appear also to approach
M. rimosipes, but that species has the margin of the pileus more
free, the stem proportionately longer, and the paraphyses as long as
the asci, if we may rely upon the figure of it. Our plant is edible.

<p class='c000'>The Edible gyromitra, formerly known as Helvella
esculenta, is easily recognized by its chestnut-red
irregularly rounded and lobed cap with its brain-like
convolutions. The margin of the cap is attached to
the stem in two or three places. When cut through
it is found to be hollow, whitish within and uneven,
with a few prominent irregular ribs or ridges. The
stem is whitish, slightly scurfy, and when mature, hollow.
In large specimens it sometimes appears as if
formed by the union of two or more smaller ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plant is 2–4 in. high and the cap commonly 2–3 in. broad.

in wet ravines or springy places in the vicinity of pine groves or pine
trees. <cite>Peck</cite>, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

it one of the best. But the species, though long ago esteemed highly
in Europe and by many in America, now rests under decided suspicion.
It is not probable that in our great food-giving country anyone will be
narrowed to G. esculenta for a meal. Until such an emergency arrives,
the species would be better let alone.</p>

these grow on damp walls, on dung, in cellars and cisterns, on spent

differ as to their qualities; some call them insipid, some speak of them

as a rule, tenacious in texture. To cook them properly requires time

<p class='c017'><strong>P. ba´dia</strong> Pers.—of a brown or bay color. (Plate <a href='#plate152'>CLII</a>, p. 554.)
Gregarious or cespitose, sessile or narrowed into a very short, stout,
stem-like base and often more or less lacunose; subglobose and closed at
first, then cup-shaped or more expanded, margin entire or nearly so, the
entire cup often wavy, rather thick, 1.2–2 in. across; disk dark-brown,
externally paler-brown and minutely granular, often with a purple tinge;
hypothecium and excipulum formed of stout, septate, irregularly inflated
hyphæ, hypothecium compact, excipulum spongy and cavernous;
cortex compact, the hyphæ running out in irregular lumps to form the
external granulations; asci cylindrical, apex truncate, 8-spored. <strong>Spores</strong>
obliquely 1-seriate, hyaline, continuous, elliptical, with one large oil-globule,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>minutely warted at maturity, 15–19×9–10µ; paraphyses septate,

<p class='c000'>P. badia is frequent on bare ground, along wood roads, etc. In the
West Virginia mountains it occurs where there have been brush fires.
It is a meaty plant, without much flavor. It must be cut fine and slowly
cooked if stewed, or can be quickly fried in a hot buttered pan. It has
more flavor fried crisp than stewed.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>P. cochlea´ta</strong>—spiral. Sessile, cespitose, variously contorted and
plicate, fleshy, brittle, disk umber-brown, externally paler and pruinose,
sometimes altogether paler and leather-color or pale dingy-ochraceous,
2–3.2 in. diameter; when solitary or almost so, at first globose, then
expanding with the margin involute, finally spreading and irregularly
plicate; excipulum spongy and cavernous, due to the loose weft formed
by interlacing, hyaline, thin-walled, flaccid, septate hyphæ, cortex compact,
running out into irregular groups of cells that form the scurfy exterior;
asci cylindrical, apex slightly truncate, 8-spored. <strong>Spores</strong> obliquely
1-seriate, hyaline, continuous, smooth, usually 2-guttulate,
16–18×7–8µ; paraphyses slender, septate; tip slightly clavate, often
curved and sometimes branched.</p>

<p class='c000'>The entire substance is brittle and rather watery, and usually assumes
a yellowish tint when bruised. Smell and taste almost none.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes the ascophores are closely crowded, hence irregular and
much contorted, and resembling a foliaceous Tremella or a small specimen

<p class='c000'>The plant when fresh has the peculiar fungoid flavor suggestive of
that of chestnut blossoms. The species is apparently allied to P.

distinct but peculiar odor. The spores also are not binucleate, as in
that species. In drying, the hymenium is apt to become blackish. <cite>Peck</cite>,

<p class='c000'>A cluster 4 inches across, in general appearance resembling P. repanda,
was found by the writer at Mt. Gretna, Pa., June, 1898, growing
from between the staves of an empty flour barrel which was exposed
to the weather. The margin, instead of being revolute, turned inward
(involute) until it touched the short stem. The cluster was eaten and
had the flavor of P. repanda. In June, 1899, several pounds grew on

externally whitish or pinkish, delicately tomentose, due to the
presence of wavy, usually aseptate, hyaline, cylindrical hyphæ, 5–6µ
thick. <strong>Stem</strong> .4-.8 in. long, 1.2–2 in. thick, whitish and tomentose.
<strong>Spores</strong> 1-seriate, elliptic-oblong, ends obtuse, hyaline, wall rather thick

<p class='c000'>This brilliant fungus is one of the beauties of the woods. Though

may be gathered from a few acres. Its substance is tenacious, taste pleasant.
Mr. Massee mentions that it is abundant in some of the woods
near Scarboro, England, and is regularly collected and sold along with
moss for decorative purposes. Exquisite effects may be produced by
arranging the brightly colored fungi among moss and leaves. “Fairy

<p class='c017'>Perithecia (the hollow narrow-mouthed cases which contain the
spores) gregarious, with a cottony stroma in which they are more or
less immersed. Mostly parasitic on various Hymenomycetes or Discomycetes;
bright colored, with papilliform (nipple-shaped) or slightly
elongated ostiola (apertures). Asci mostly cylindrical, 8-spored, without
paraphyses. Sporidia oblong or fusoid, uniseptate, hyaline. Conidial
stage represented by Asterophora, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>This parasite attacks several species of fungi, and so alters their
structure and appearance that it is difficult to distinguish the host-plant.
The attack is made in the extreme youth of the plant. The writer is
fully satisfied from his own observation that H. lactifluorum and H.
purpurea infest Lactarius piperatus. The milk cells are so changed by
H. lactifluorum that they yield no milk. When attacked by H. purpurea
the milk is a beautiful purple. In both cases the pepperiness of
the host-plant is destroyed. I have seen the same host plant attacked
by both forms of the Hypomyces. After the host-plant of Hypomyces
lactifluorum is fully grown, and infested, it is frequently attacked by
Hypomyces purpureus. Purple spots appear, which gradually spread
until the entire plant is covered. This Hypomyces seems to affect the
milk cells. A beautiful, profuse, purple fluid results.</p>

<p class='c000'>The parasite is proving itself an enemy to fungi, but a friend to man.
Upon L. piperatus and upon Amanita rubescens it very much adds to
the weight of the plants, and improves the texture and edible qualities.
The same may be said of L. volemus, but not to such a degree. Prof.
M.W. Easton in August, 1899, found this species at Mt. Gretna, Pa.,
attacked by a parasitic fungus in such a manner as to destroy its milk-giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>quality and completely transform its gills into a corrugated,
granular surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck, to whom I submitted the parasite, thinks it a new
species and calls it H. volemi.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further study of Hypomyces and its effect upon fungi, and of the
particular host-plants is desirable.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>H. lac´tifluorum</strong> (Schw.) Tulasne—<em>lac</em>, milk; <em>fluorum</em>, flowing.
(Plate <a href='#plate136'>CXXXVI</a>, fig. 5, p. 508.) Asci long and slender, sporidia in
one row, spindle-shaped, straight or slightly curved, rough, hyaline,
uniseptate, cuspidate-pointed at the ends, 30–38×6–8µ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general appearance is much the same as that of H. aurantius
(Pers.) Tul., but the sporidia are larger, rough and warted, and the
felt-like mycelium is wanting.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the affected species of Lactarius the gills are entirely obliterated,
so that the hymenium of the agaric presents an even, orange-colored
surface on which the subglobose perithecia are thickly bedded, with
only their slightly prominent reddish ostiola visible. In decay the color
changes to a purplish-red.</p>

<p class='c000'>This fungus puzzled me for many years. August, 1896, I sent several
specimens to Professor Peck of different colors—orange, red, whitish
and purple.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Peck kindly identified the specimens and wrote: “In one
the matrix of the host-plant has not been so completely changed or
transformed as in the other. It would be interesting to know what
species of Lactarius it is that Hypomyces attacks. I have never been
able to ascertain, and have sometimes thought it might be Cantharellus
cibarius, but this specimen of yours indicates, rather, a Lactarius.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the purple specimen he wrote: “This is a beautiful thing, and
as I find nothing like it described I have given it a name—Hypomyces
purpureus Peck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Well cooked, in small pieces, it is one of the very best.</p>

sunk in the subiculum, the ostiola emergent, black; asci cylindrical;
spores fusiform, uniseptate, purple, with a cusp-like point at each end,
35–40µ long, 7.5µ broad, oozing out and forming beautiful purple
masses or patches on the surface of the matrix.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pennsylvania. August. <cite>Charles McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>The species is similar in all respects to H. lactifluorum, except in
color. It is apparently parasitic on some species of Lactarius, but the
host plant is so transformed and discolored that the species is not
recognizable. <cite>Peck</cite>, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 25, No. 6.</p>

<p class='c000'>H. purpureus Pk. was sent by the writer to Professor Peck in August,
1897, who wrote: “This is a beautiful thing and as I find nothing
like it described, I have given it a name.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of itself H. purpureus is a minute parasitic fungus as above described.
But it possesses the power of so altering the structure—changing form,
shape and appearance—of the fungus upon which it has taken its abode
that the host-plant, be it Cantharellus cibarius, Craterellus cantharellus
or one of the Lactari, or whatever the species, becomes difficult to recognize,
so that it is not yet certain upon which species it is parasitic.
It may be upon many.</p>

<p class='c000'>The present plant seems to be parasitic upon one of the Lactarii. It
therefore becomes necessary to describe the host as it appears when
possessed by the parasite. The plant is variable in shape from an irregular
nodule to a distorted-capped, short-stemmed mass, 2–4 in.
across, 1–3 in. high, hard, brittle, coarse in appearance and rough to
the touch; deep orange, wholly or in part stained with a beautiful purple.
The purple juice exudes and dyes everything with which it comes
in contact. The growth is very heavy for its size.</p>

<p class='c000'>To all appearances it is the same host as is attacked by Hypomyces
lactifluorum, resembling it in every particular excepting in the purple
stain and juice.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is frequent in open oak and chestnut woods, but prefers oak. It
grows from among leaves or from grassy spots. August to October.</p>

<p class='c000'>While it is beautiful in its coloring it is not inviting in appearance as
an edible. Yet sliced, cut small and stewed for twenty minutes it is one
of the very best fungi I have eaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>Subterranean; ascophore irregularly globose, usually large, not rupturing.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this family belongs the Truffle
of commerce renowned for its flavoring
qualities. It has not yet
been found in America, though
several fungi are ignorantly bought
in our markets under that name;
notably Coprinus comatus or maned
mushroom. The writer has frequently
been informed with all the
logical force of genuine market-women
that this was the real Truffle,
because they raised it themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until quite recently but one
species of Truffle has been reported
as growing in America. This, Tuber niveum Desf. or Terfezia leonis
Tul. was found by Rev. A.B. Langlois, St. Martinville, La. He reported
it as growing plentifully, buried or nearly so in the red sand land
along the Red river near Natchitoches. He writes me: “The people
where it is found are looking for it with great care and are eating it with
great relish. I had occasion to eat it once and I found it delicious.”
He kindly sent the original illustration from which the accompanying
drawing was made. It was taken from Jour. Myc., January, 1887, J.
B. Ellis, who first published a description of the American representative
of the species. He describes it as “subglobose, up to full two
inches in diameter, strongly plicate or furrowed below, nearly smooth
and pale reddish-brown outside, marbled-white within and of compact
texture much like a potato, but softer. When first dug from the ground
the color is pure white, the reddish tint being due to exposure to the
air. The asci obovate or subglobose, 75–80×60–70µ. Each contains
eight globose spores, thickly clothed with obtuse, elongated, wart-like
tubercles and about 20µ in diameter. The home of the white Truffle is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>said to be in Northern Africa, though it is not uncommon in Southern
Europe, where its growth is favored by mild winters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is probable that the Truffle will be found in other southern states.
Perhaps in the north, as Fries reports that two specimens were found
near Linkoping, Sweden, and Mr. H.W. Harkness reports Tubers in the
Sierras at the height of 7,000 feet. It is worth hunting for.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is possible that the common Truffle—Tuber æstivum—will be found
in America. Fame awaits the finder. A description of it with illustration
is therefore given.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Tuber æsti´vum</strong> Vitt. Peridium warty, of a blackish-brown color,

<p class='c000'>This plant, the common Truffle of
our markets, is abundant in Wiltshire
and some other parts of England,
and probably occurs in many
places where it escapes observation
from its subterranean habit. <cite>Badham.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>It is cultivated largely in France.
“Perigord Truffles” are a costly
delicacy. The Truffle is of subterranean habit, growing under various
kinds of trees and from 12–48 in. under ground. As it does not manifest
its presence above ground, dogs and pigs are trained to find it by
scent. An interesting chapter on Truffles will be found in British
Edible Fungi, M.C. Cooke, 1891. Any plant of similar habit, when
found, should be immediately sent by the finder to a known expert for
identification.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirteen species of Tuber and several Terfeziæ are reported in California,
and are described and beautifully illustrated in “California
Hypogæous Fungi” by H.W. Harkness, “Proceedings of the California
Academy of Sciences,” 1899.</p>

<p class='c000'>Terfezia spinosa Harkness closely resembles T. leonis Tul., and T.
(sphærotuber) Californicum n. sp., found under oaks beneath vegetable
humus in Alameda county, Cal., Professor Harkness remarks, is nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>identical with an edible species found in Italy. All species found in
California are said to be edible, but to be too rare to be of food value.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a well known growth, found from New Jersey south to the
Gulf and west to Kansas, called Tuckahoe
(Pachyma cocos), (Plate <a href='#plate155'>CLV</a>),
an Indian name meaning a round loaf or
cake, and famed for its edible qualities.
Its exact place in plant growth has been
variously determined. It is now conceded
that it is the sclerotium or cellular
reservoir of reserve material of some
fungus. It is usually found attached to
the roots of trees, in low marshy places.
It grows several feet below the surface,
and to the size of a man’s head. It
varies in shape, being oblong or round,
having a coarse brown covering, looking
like a cocoanut. Its interior is white,
compact, without cellular structure; it
has no mycelium or trace of fructification.
It contains as high as 77 per cent. of pectose and is therefore
highly nutritious.</p>

<p class='c000'>As has been stated, the two Cohorts in which a hymenium or spore-bearing
surface is present are called Hymenomycetes and Gastromycetes.
In the first the hymenium is exposed, as in the common mushroom. In
the second—Gastromycetes—the hymenium is at first enclosed in a sac
or peridium, as in the common puff-ball.</p>

<p class='c000'>The botanical description of Gastromycetes, given by M.C. Cooke,
is: “Hymenium more or less permanently concealed, consisting in
most cases of closely-packed cells, of which the fertile ones bear naked
spores on distinct spicules, exposed only by the rupture or decay of the
insisting coat or peridium.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The Gastromycetes are usually large, ground-growing fungi. A few
grow upon wood. The peridium is of dense structure, usually globose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>and of considerable thickness.  It commonly consists of two layers.
These form the sac holding the spore-bearing structure, which is called
the gleba. The gleba consists of innumerable chambers or cells,
curved and branched, and only to be distinguished by magnifying.
The primary structure is retained in some species throughout the life of
the plants, excepting changes due to growth and maturing, or in others
these cells or chambers are large and few, and form distinct peridiola,
which contain the spores.</p>

<p class='c000'>The maturing of the plant and the consequent changes in the gleba
is accompanied by various transformations of the peridium.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible within the scope of this book to even name all the
genera of Gastromycetes. Professor Morgan’s table of the families and
table of the genera of Lycoperdaceæ are here given. The orders are
defined as are some of the genera, and the edible species are described.</p>

<p class='c000'>P. impudicus makes itself known wherever it grows. The stench of
the full-grown plant is aggravatingly offensive, attracting blow-flies in
quantities, and the carrion beetle Necrophorus Americanus. It is
common over the United States, in woods, open fence corners, along
road-sides, but a favorite abode is in kitchen yards and under wooden
steps, where, when mature, it will compel the household to seek it in
self-defense. It is a beautiful plant.</p>

<p class='c000'>When in the egg-shape it is white or light dull-green, semi-gelatinous,
tenacious and elastic. As many as a dozen sometimes grow in a bunch,
each from a peculiar white, cord-like root or mycelium. They look,
when young, like bubbles of some thick substance. In this condition
they are very good when fried. They demand to be eaten at this time,
if at any.</p>

<p class='c000'>G. minimus, when found by the
writer, was not tested because not
found in condition. It is a plant
beautiful in its oddity. Its seven to
nine outer segments of skin loosen
at the bottom, spring up, raising
the oval body of the plant with
them, turn their points down and
balance on the lower points, and look,
in miniature, just as would two sectional
orange peels spread at their
loose points if one was rested, point
to point, upon the other. This hoisting of the spore-bearing part aloft,
that it may better eject its spores to the wind, does not seem to have
been noted by Professor Morgan. Specimens sent to Professor Peck
by the writer beautifully illustrated this enterprise of the plant.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>G. hygrome´tricus</strong> Pers. (Plate <a href='#plate160'>CLX</a>, 2 figs., p. 580.) Peridium
depressed-globose, the cuticle deciduous with the mycelium; outer
peridium deeply parted, the segments 7–20, strongly hygrometric,
acute at the apex; inner peridium depressed-globose, sessile, reticulate,
pitted, whitish becoming gray or brownish; the mouth an irregularly
lacerate aperture. Threads of the capillitium rather thinner than the
spores, hyaline. <strong>Spores</strong> globose, minutely warted, brown, 8–11µ in.
in diameter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Growing in fields and woods in sandy soil. A very common species
found everywhere in the world. Inner peridium ¾-1 in. in diameter,
the segments expanding to a breadth of 2–3 in. The inner layer of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>outer peridium is cartilaginous-gelatinous, hard and rigid when dry,
swelling greatly and flexible when wet though constantly becoming
more and more cracked and fissured, it retains its hygroscopic qualities
a long time, and the outer peridium remains lying on the soil, stellate
in shape, spreading out its rays in moist weather and bending them
inward in dry. <cite>Morgan.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Morgan made a new genus—Astræus, in which he placed this
species. It is so widely known as Geaster hygrometricus that to avoid
confusion it is placed in its old genus.</p>

<p class='c000'>This natural barometer, spreading its stellate covering on the soil
about it when the air is laden with moisture, and closing it around
its puffy body when humidity is absent, is odd and interesting. The
entire genus is more or less gifted with this weather-wise quality. The
species is very common, but seldom found in number. Once, in the
West Virginia mountains, 1882, I found a large patch of it, and was
able to collect from it enough young ones to test its edibility. It is
difficult to find before it bursts its outer coat. When young it is,
when cooked, soft and creamy inside. The outer part is tough and
semi-glutinous but of pleasant texture. It has not a marked flavor, but
makes a succulent dish.</p>

with a short, thick, stem-like base; capillitium and spores purple-brown,
these and the upper part of the peridium falling away and disappearing
when old, leaving a cup-shaped base with a ragged margin. <strong>Spores</strong>
globose, rough, purple-brown, 5–6.5µ broad. <cite>Peck</cite>, 48th Rep. N.Y.

<p class='c000'>Common over United States. Indiana, <cite>H.I. Miller</cite>; West Virginia,
New Jersey. On open grassy ground. July to October. <cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Often a queer, ragged, cup-shaped, purplish mass is noticed protruding
from the ground, looking as if the upper half had been cut off horizontally.
This is the mature C. cyathiformis, or rather, what is left of
it. The upper half has blown away and is spreading its spores elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>A first-class Lycoperdon, meaty and of excellent flavor. When it
occurs, it is usually in plenty. On the great parade ground at Mt.
Gretna, Pa., it annually appears in large quantities. Cows are fond of
it, and it is this fungus which is currently believed among farmers to
affect milk. I have watched cows pawing it to pieces and eating portions
of it.</p>

<h5 class='c027'><span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>GENUS IX.—<strong>LYCOPER´DON</strong> Tourn.</h5>

<p class='c017'>Mycelium fibrous, rooting from the base. <strong>Peridium</strong> small, globose,
obovoid or turbinate, with a more or less thickened base; cortex a subpersistent

<p class='c000'>When the plant sits (without stem) directly upon the ground or
wood it is <em>sessile</em>. The outer layer of the two parts of its covering is
the <em>exterior peridium</em> (sometimes spoken of as <em>cortex</em>). This frequently
breaks up into scales, spines, bristles, minute flocculent or powdery
masses, and these vary in size and in many species disappear as the
plant matures. These are of determining value in several species of
Lycoperdaceæ. Plants with coarse, long spines are <em>echinate</em> because
they bristle. When the spines incline together and form a point they
are <em>stellate</em>. Various formations of this outside covering are also called
<em>warts</em>. The inner rind or skin is the true <em>peridium</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mass of thread-like filaments which fills the interior of the plant
is called the <em>capillitium</em>. The filaments are deftly interlaced. At times
filaments springing from the base do not interlace with the others; these
are called <em>columellæ</em>. These filaments bear the spores—the dust which
puffs out in such quantity and gives the common name to the plant—puff-ball—and
its Mephistophelian one—The Devil’s Snuff-box. In
some species the filaments at the base of the plant are <em>sterile</em>—they do
not bear spores. These filaments are more contracted and form the
neck, stem or <em>subgleba</em>. The <em>gleba</em> is the upper interior of the plant,
in which the spores are contained. See plate <a href='#plate156'>CLVI</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Dehiscent</em> is said of an organ which opens of itself at maturity. A
plant is dehiscent at the discharging point of its spores. If this is at
the summit it is <em>apically dehiscent</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The descriptions herein given of American representatives of European
species are in many instances those of A.P. Morgan, who has made
special study of this genus, and those of Professor C.H. Peck, whose
interstate experience acquaints him with every varying form. Mr. Morgan
has kindly given permission to use his text and drawings.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one has yet had reason to doubt the harmlessness of any puff-ball.
There are a few I have not eaten, but believing that these will be
proven edible, descriptions of all species occurring in America are given.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>There are first and second-class puff-balls. Usually the small species
are slightly strong, and if a shade of yellow appears upon breaking any
puff-ball, it will be more or less bitter and will spoil a whole dish. The
larger species are milder. The flavor of puff-balls appears to be issued
to them as a ration. It is all there in a little fellow, and in a big one it
is simply spread through more substance.</p>

any satisfactory line of distinction between them.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are three principal varieties which I have referred to this
species. The first is usually 1–2 in. broad, sessile, or with a very short
stem, nearly smooth, being mealy or pruinose, and having a few minute,
weak, scattered spinules or scales. Its color is generally whitish or
white slightly clouded with brown. It grows in sandy pastures and
cleared lands, and is probably the nearest of the three in its resemblance
to the type.</p>

<p class='c000'>I regard the second and third as worthy of a name and designate and
define them as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>hirtel´lum</em>. <strong>Peridium</strong> hairy-spinulose with erect or curved
sometimes stellately united spinules, which are often of a blackish color.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ground and decaying vegetable matter in woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>stella´re</em>. <strong>Peridium</strong> echinate or stellately echinate with rather
stout easily deciduous spines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ground in woods and bushy places.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this species the capillitium and spores are at first greenish-yellow,
olive-tinted or brownish; but when fully mature they are purple-tinted.
Some care will, therefore, be necessary, lest the last variety be confused

<p class='c000'>Var. <em>papilla´tum</em>. Subrotund, sessile, papillose, furfuraceous-pulverulent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very common and known in all countries. It is, to my thinking, our

solitary or in small groups, but at times these groups contain scores of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>individuals. It grows in the open on the ground or from both ground
and wood, in woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>I think it equal to any other puff-ball. But great care must be taken
to examine each specimen before putting it into the pan. A single one,
which has turned yellow in the slightest degree, will spoil a whole dish.

<p class='c000'>The pedicellate spores constitute the peculiar feature of this species.
It is one which suggests the name and which enables the species to be
easily distinguished from all its allies. The spore is terminally and persistently
attached to the pedicel, as in some species of Bovista. The
plant is sometimes sessile, but usually it is narrowed below into a stem-like
base. In the immature state it has a rough, shaggy appearance,
but the spines shrivel with age so that it appears less rough when old.
The pitted surface of the denuded peridium affords a mark of distinction
from L. echinatum. L. pulcherrimum B. and C. is evidently the
same species, but the name here adopted has priority of publication.

several individuals closely crowded together. It sometimes occurs in
cultivated grounds and stubble fields. The under surface is occasionally
plicate as in the long-stemmed puff-ball. In the var. separans the
warts or spines are crowded at their thickened bases and slightly attached
to each other, so that they come off at maturity in flakes or
patches. When the denuded surface of the peridium is velvety, it is
usually of a darker color than when smooth, being subcinnamon, reddish-brown

peridium like a cap or inverted cup; consequently the apparent
apex at which the mouth is situated is the actual base of the plant as it

hyphæ, which form the inner peridium and are evidently branches of
them radiating from the interior. It is plain that the affinities of these

<p class='c017'>The poisonous mushrooms, or so-called toadstools, may be grouped
in two classes: (1) Those containing minor or irritant poisons, which
act locally on the gastro-intestinal tract, such as the Clitocybe illudens,
Lepiota Morgani and others, and (2) those containing major poisons
which act on the nerve centers after absorption, causing symptoms to
appear a long time after the poison has been taken and very often terminating
fatally. This group includes the Amanita muscaria, the
Amanita bulbosa or Am. verna and the Amanita phalloides.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the prompt way in which vomiting and purging begin after
eating the toadstools of the first group there seems to be no doubt of the
local irritant action on the alimentary canal. Grave symptoms from
any constitutional effect or any serious disturbances of the circulation do
not occur. Although intensely disagreeable, such poisoning terminates
in recovery and may not be regarded as dangerous unless the poison be
taken in enormous quantity or by one in poor health.</p>

<p class='c000'>In poisoning by the deadly toxic Amanitæ vomiting and purging may
also occur as prominent symptoms, but generally only occur late—ten
to fifteen hours after eating the toadstool—and are due to the action of
the poison on the nerve centers. This is clear from the fact that these
symptoms appear when the poison is given either hypodermatically or
intravenously to animals.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is exceedingly unfortunate that these deadly poisonous toadstools
do not give some warning either in an unpleasant taste or contain an
irritant which would act locally to cause emesis and purgation, for in
that case the patient would get rid of the poison before such large
quantities were absorbed and fatal poisoning would be less frequent.
They are not at all unpalatable and sometimes large quantities are eaten
by mistake.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>Formerly frequent allusion was made to the possibility of poisoning
by decomposition products from putrefactive changes in mushrooms.
Not a single case has come to the writer’s notice where this form of
poisoning has <em>actually</em> occurred. In many reported cases of poisoning
it is distinctly stated they were eaten soon after gathering; in none does
the reporter mention any suspicion of poisoning of this nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one time very many mushrooms were supposed to be poisonous.
We now know that there are only a few dangerous ones, and
where serious poisoning occurs it seems clearly to be due to some definite
and constant poisons contained in certain fungi. We shall not deal
here with the irritant poisons, as they are not dangerous and usually
Nature gets rid of them easily, but shall consider the poisons of the
Amanita muscaria or “Fly mushroom,” the A. bulbosus vernus Bull. or
A. verna, and the A. phalloides or “death cup.” The writer has not had
any personal experience with poisoning by these in man, but bases his
observations upon over one hundred experiments made upon lower animals.<a id='rC' /><a href='#fC' class='c019'><sup>[C]</sup></a>
This is a distinct advantage in reaching any conclusion, as the facts
are definite without any doubt as to the <em>kind</em> or <em>quantity</em> of the poison
taken. In many of the reports of poisoning by mushrooms in man no
mention of the species is made. In all these cases many kinds have been
mixed together in preparing them for the table and it has never been known
how many of the poisonous and how many of the edible ones have been
eaten by any one individual partaking of the dish. Of course the fluid
in which they are cooked contains some of the poison. This explains
why some patients recover after having eaten several mushrooms while
others die from a part of one only. (See report of six cases by Dr. G.E.
Caglieri, New York Med. Record, August 28, 1897; also Dr. Berry’s
cases reported by Prentiss, Philadelphia Med. Journal, September 24,
1898.) Then, too, different poisonous species may be mixed together.
The symptoms produced by the different Amanitæ poisons are quite
different. Those containing irritant poisons may be taken with those
containing deadly poisons. This accounts for the great variety of symptoms
presented in cases reported.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fC'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#rC'>C</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All of the toadstools used have been very kindly furnished and identified by Capt.
Chas. McIlvaine. Unfortunately only fifteen experiments could be made with the fresh
fungi while the writer was at the University of Pennsylvania. Since leaving there it
has been impossible to get any in a fresh state, and the other experiments have been
made either with dried fungi or alcoholic or glycerine extracts of the fresh.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>
<h3 class='c025'>POISONING BY AMANITA MUSCARIA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c026'>The symptoms of poisoning by this fungus usually appear from eight
to twelve hours after it has been eaten, unless it has been taken in
enormous quantities, as in the cases reported by Prentiss (Phila. Med.
Jour., September 24, 1898), where they came on in half an hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>These begin with cramp-like pains in the extremities, colicky pains
in the abdomen, burning thirst, vomiting and purging. The pulse may
be very slow and strong at first, but later becomes rapid, small and feeble.
The blood pressure is low and, as a result of this disturbance of
the circulation, faintness is a common early symptom. Extreme pallor
is often noticed. The secretions are increased, and the sweat and the
saliva may be secreted in abnormal quantities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pupils are strongly contracted and dullness of the vision or
double vision may be noticed early.</p>

<p class='c000'>The respirations are slow and become shallow and stertorous when
the poisoning is severe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mental state may be clear at first, but becomes dull, deepening
into unconsciousness and deep coma if a large quantity has been taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>Convulsions are reported to have occurred in some cases from poisoning
by this toadstool in man. The dried Amanita muscaria or extracts
of the fresh fail to produce convulsions in the lower animals, even in
frogs, which are very susceptible. Either there is a considerable difference
in the susceptibility to this poison or there is some poison present
in the fresh fungus which is lost by drying.</p>

<p class='c000'>Small amounts of the dried Amanita muscaria are said to be used by
inhabitants of northern Asia for the stimulating effect upon the nervous
system, producing, like other narcotic poisons, a dreamy state of intoxication,
deepening into sleep (Von Boeck in Ziemssen’s Cyclopedia of
Medicine, Vol. VII).</p>

<p class='c000'>In animals the most striking effect is upon the circulation. When injected
intravenously it causes tremendous inhibition of the heart’s action—a
moderate amount causing the heart to beat slowly and powerfully;
a large amount causing complete arrest. Even with the partial inhibition
there is an enormous fall of pressure. The slowing of the heart
soon passes off, and when a moderate amount has been injected, the circulation
quickly returns to normal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>In one of my experiments on a dog, the heart stopped for 1¾ minutes
and then began beating again, the circulation soon recovering.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late in the poisoning the heart beats may be rapid and feeble and the
blood pressure low. The lowered blood pressure is largely due to
dilatation of the small blood vessels resulting from a loss of control over
them by the nerve center which normally keeps the arterioles in a state
of partial contraction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inhibition of the heart is due to the action of the well-known
alkaloid <em>muscarine</em> upon nerve ganglia in the heart. The contraction
of the pupil and the increased secretory activity of the glands are also
due to this substance which was discovered by Schmideberg and Koppe
in 1869.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was soon found that although dogs recovered from the <em>immediate</em>
or <em>early effects</em> (<em>i. e.</em>, from the muscarine) of enormous quantities of toadstools,
they succumbed from the <em>late effects of much smaller quantities</em>.
Atropine fails to avert this result from the late effect, whether given before
the poison, with it, or after it. The inhibition of the heart passes
off long before death occurs. Late death does not appear to be due to
muscarine.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these facts put together point to the existence of some other
poison or poisons in the Amanita muscaria to which atropine is <em>not</em> an
antidote.</p>

<p class='c000'>This peculiar poisoning causing death so late will be discussed again
after considering the other poisonous mushrooms as they act similarly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gastro-intestinal symptoms were not as common in my experiments
with Amanita muscaria as with the Amanita phalloides. Vomiting and
purging occasionally occurred early, but much more frequently late in
the poisoning and often not at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Convulsions did not occur in any of the animals poisoned by this
fungus. Convulsions are recorded in some cases of poisoning in man,
but not so constantly as with the A. phalloides and A. verna. Where
they occurred either a large amount had been taken (as in Prentiss'
case) or there is some doubt about the Amanita muscaria having been
the only toadstool eaten (as in Caglieri’s cases). Frogs are very easily
thrown into spasms, but no spasms were observed, even in fatal poisoning
of them by this toadstool.</p>

<p class='c000'>Regarding cerebral symptoms, little can be said except that unconsciousness
and coma may come on early and persist till death. In cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>terminating fatally the animal seemed to be conscious, but so depressed
that it was unable to stand or even move when called.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning differences in the susceptibility of different animals to the
poisons of Amanita muscaria, cats seemed to be more susceptible than
dogs in the earlier experiments with extracts of the fresh fungus, but
more numerous experiments with the dried fungus failed to show any
greater difference than can be observed between different animals of the
same kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the nature of the poisons very little can be stated from the experiments,
as they were undertaken as a preliminary step to chemical
studies to be carried on later. The alkaloid muscarine is one of our
best known poisons and nothing can be added to what is already known
about it. The poisons are extracted by distilled water as well as by a
solution of sodium chloride; they are soluble in glycerine and in alcohol
and very little difference can be seen in the action of these extracts, unless
the alcoholic extract contains more of the muscarine, while the
glycerine extract contains more of the other poisons.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is stated that muscarine is not poisonous to flies; that the Amanita
muscaria contains a volatile poison which is poisonous to flies (hence
the name “Fly mushroom”), and which is lost by drying; that inhabitants
of northern Asia use the <em>dried</em> fungus (after the volatile poison has
been lost) for producing intoxication (Von Boeck in Ziemssen’s Cyclopedia,
Vol. VII, p. 927). My experiments have been entirely with
mammals and frogs, and unfortunately those performed with the fresh
toadstools were not numerous enough to enable me to draw positive
conclusions as to any loss of toxicity by drying. A single experiment
with a cat seemed to indicate that boiling of the fungus lessened the
toxicity but subsequent experiments indicated that a boiled solution was
no less toxic than one not boiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>One thing we can state definitely; that boiling the dried A. muscaria
does not destroy its toxicity. This indicates that the poison is not of
an albuminous nature, which would be coagulated by heat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether or not any volatile poison is lost by boiling a solution of the
fresh fungus or by drying at 40° C. can not be stated definitely as the
experiments made with the fresh fungus were few in number on account
of the extreme difficulty in getting them perfectly fresh.</p>

<p class='c000'>The average of six observations in which it was possible to weigh
the toadstools before and after drying at 40° C. showed a loss of 84.4
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>per cent. of water. In other words, 1 gram of the dried equals 6.4
grams of the fresh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Comparing the lethal doses of the <em>dried</em> with the lethal doses of the
<em>fresh</em> extracted by glycerine and alcohol, it does not appear that there
is any great loss of the toxicity by drying as is shown by the following:
Lethal dose of dried in Experiment 31 was .085 gram. per kilo of body
weight; in Experiment 55, .033 gram. per kilo caused <em>early</em> death,
while .223 gram. of dried per kilo and .120 gram. per kilo caused
death from <em>late</em> effects (Exps. 32 and 57). The lethal doses of the <em>fresh</em>
were .91 gram. per kilo (Exp. 29) and 1.055 gram. per kilo (Exp.
36) when a glycerine extract of the fresh growth was used, while 1.222
gram. per kilo (Exp. 16) made from an alcoholic extract failed to kill.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be well to introduce here the results of an experiment which
shows there is no highly poisonous volatile material given off from the
A. phalloides. This is rather an important fact to determine, as the
opinion is held by some that there is a volatile poison, and most of my
experiments were made with the dried fungus. A 1 per cent. solution
of fresh A. phalloides was distilled until three-fourths of the fluid had
passed over as distillate. The latter was injected into the vein of a dog
and found not at all toxic. The opportunity has not been afforded me
of repeating this experiment personally, but Dr. J.P. Arnold has kindly
repeated it for me, injecting the distillate into rabbits and frogs and failed
to find it toxic. Certainly if there is any volatile poison in the A. phalloides
it must be either in very minute quantity or very slightly toxic.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>ANTIDOTAL VALUE OF ATROPINE.</h3>

<p class='c026'>In arriving at any conclusion we must bear in mind the variation of
different animals in their susceptibility to poisons. Thus, to give the
greatest difference observed, .085 gram. dried Amanita muscaria
per kilo of body weight killed one dog in an hour, while in another
dog .223 grams. of the same preparation per kilo only killed after 24
hours, the cardiac inhibition having disappeared one-half hour after the
poison was injected. However, an average of six (6) experiments on
cats and dogs with dried A. muscaria in which no antidote was given
shows the lethal dose to be .103 gram. per kilo of body weight. The
average of four (4) experiments, in which the fungus, dried in the same
way, was used but <em>atropine was given as an antidote</em>, gives the lethal
dose of .335 gram. per kilo and death only occurred <em>late</em> in each case.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>There can be no doubt, therefore, of the antidotal value of atropine for
poisoning by Amanita muscaria.</p>

<p class='c000'>It should be borne in mind, however, that it is not an infallible antidote
even when given early, and that it does not prevent death from the
<em>late effects</em> in severe cases, although given in large doses. In some experiments
atropine was administered at the same time the poison was
given and in others before it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The important practical lesson is that too much reliance should not
be placed upon atropine. It will be shown later that it has little value
as an antidote to A. verna and A. phalloides. Probably these fungi
contain less muscarine than A. muscaria. Although there is no drug
so antagonistic in its physiological action to the poison of the A. muscaria
as atropine, the use of other remedies should not be neglected.
The symptoms have to be treated as they arise. Strychnia, alcohol in
moderate amounts and suprarenal extract could all be used to advantage
in restoring the circulation, especially late in the poisoning.
Atropine merely removes the inhibition of the heart which occurs as an
early symptom.</p>

<p class='c000'>External heat should be applied if the body temperature is subnormal.
The treatment of gastro-intestinal symptoms will depend upon
the conditions of each individual case. The injection of a large amount
of warm physiological salt solution (.6-.7 per cent. sodium chloride)
into the subcutaneous tissues should also be tried in severe cases seen
late in the poisoning.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>POISONING BY AMANITA VERNA OR A. BULBOSUS VERNA BULL.</h3>

<p class='c026'>The symptoms appear from six to fifteen hours after the ingestion of
the poison and may be largely choleraic in nature, <em>i. e.</em>, vomiting and
purging, the discharges from the bowel being watery with small flakes
suspended and sometimes containing blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The disturbance of the circulation is somewhat similar to that caused
by A. muscaria, viz., slow, strong pulse early, but rapid and weak later.
Dizziness and faintness may be early symptoms. Sometimes the skin
is pale and covered with cold, clammy sweat; at others there is great
cyanosis. The body temperature is subnormal, unless nervous symptoms
are very severe. Very prominent among the symptoms are tetanic
convulsions, which may appear comparatively early and persist until
the end.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>In animals the effect of this toadstool is entirely different from that of
A. muscaria. Perhaps the most striking difference is the frequency
with which convulsions appear. Convulsions occurred repeatedly in
mammals and in nearly every frog to which the toadstool was given.
This fungus seems to contain some poison that acts upon the spinal cord
very much as strychnia does, though less powerfully, of course.</p>

<p class='c000'>The circulatory conditions are also different. The inhibition of the
heart may be pronounced as an early condition, but the pressure does
not return to the normal after this disappears, either from giving
atropine or from cutting the pneumogastric nerves. Section of these
nerves removes the cardiac inhibition much more completely than after
poisoning by the A. muscaria. There is often a fall of pressure without
cardiac inhibition. In other words, there is a much greater permanent
fall of blood-pressure due to paralysis of the nerve center controlling
the blood vessels (vaso-motor center). This condition will last a long
time and does not show the same tendency to disappear as after A.
muscaria. Moreover it is produced by comparatively small amounts
of the A. verna.</p>

<p class='c000'>The respirations are very slow. The blood is poorly oxygenated and
this probably causes the cyanosis sometimes observed in men poisoned
by this fungus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bloody fluid is sometimes vomited or comes from the nose. It may
also occur in the discharge from the bowel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Retching and purging occurred more frequently as early symptoms
than in animals poisoned by A. muscaria.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coma appeared early and continued until death. The administration
of atropine soon after giving the poison when cardiac inhibition was
present, caused a slight temporary rise of blood pressure but did not
affect the dilated condition of the blood vessels. The pressure continued
low notwithstanding the atropine. Although the experiments
with this fungus were not as numerous as with the A. muscaria because
of difficulty in obtaining it, yet it seems clear that atropine is of very
little value as an antidote. Death very rarely resulted from the cardiac
inhibition occurring early but usually came on late after that condition
had disappeared. The lethal dose was no larger when atropine was
given than when no antidote was used.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amanita verna is very much more toxic than A. muscaria, the average
of four experiments in which the former was given without an antidote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>being .034 gram. (dried) per kilo of body weight, while .103 gram.
(dried) per kilo, was the average for the latter fungus.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>POISONING BY AMANITA PHALLOIDES.</h3>

<p class='c026'>The symptoms described in man are very similar to those caused by
the A. verna, except that the convulsions are less constant and cyanosis
is not mentioned. In some cases vomiting and purging are prominent
symptoms. There is dizziness and fainting, extreme ashy pallor, cold
skin covered with sweat, subnormal temperature, muscular twitchings
and occasional convulsions and somnolence which deepens into coma
and lasts until death, which usually occurs two or three days after eating
the poison. Sometimes the gastro-intestinal symptoms are less severe
or may be absent, though they are usually present; in that case the
nervous symptoms are more prominent, particularly the convulsions and
circulatory disturbance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In experiments upon animals the convulsions were not observed so
constantly as with the A. verna. Out of twenty-five dogs poisoned by the
Amanita phalloides, convulsions only occurred twice, while twelve frogs
injected with different preparations (dried toadstool and glycerine and
alcoholic extracts of the fresh) failed to show a convulsive seizure in a
single instance. It seems to be difficult for mycologists to draw a sharp
line between the A. verna and the A. phalloides and say to which of
these two certain fungi belong. This may explain why convulsions are
recorded more frequently in persons poisoned by this toadstool than in
animals poisoned by it. Frogs are very susceptible to poisons acting
upon the spinal cord, and all of those poisoned by lethal doses of A.
verna had convulsions, while none of those poisoned by the A. phalloides
had any. It would therefore appear from this striking difference
in the physiological actions that the two are separate and distinct.</p>

<p class='c000'>The circulatory and gastro-intestinal symptoms were quite similar to
those caused by the A. verna.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. phalloides is less toxic than the A. verna, but more so than the
A. muscaria, the average lethal dose of the dried fungus (eight experiments)
for dogs, where no antidote was used, being .117 gram. per
kilo.</p>

<p class='c000'>The antidotal value of atropine is very slight, if indeed it has any
action other than removing the temporary cardiac inhibition. The animals
very seldom died from this, but mostly from the late effects after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_630'>630</span>the inhibition had disappeared. In four experiments on dogs in which
atropine was given either at the same time as the poison or before it,
the average lethal dose was .198 gram. of the dried fungus per kilo.
Two dogs were killed by .1 gram. per kilo without atropine; another
was given the same amount and was given atropine hypodermatically a
number of times and recovered, though very ill for two days.</p>

<p class='c000'>Transfusion of physiological salt solution (.6 per cent. table salt)
was practiced in three dogs. Although death occurred in all of these
and the lethal dose was not unusually high, the pressure was restored
for a time at least. It should be employed in treating poisoning in man,
and not be depended upon as the <em>only</em> procedure, but used in conjunction
with other remedies. This will be referred to again in describing
treatment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen from the above that poisoning by the A. verna and
A. phalloides present symptoms in the lower animals which are quite
different from those caused by the A. muscaria, and that in either case
poisoning is far more serious than by the latter fungus. This is not only
because they are so much more toxic, but also because there is no decidedly
antagonistic action by atropine, and hence its value as an antidote
is much less.</p>

<p class='c000'>In treating a case of poisoning by either A. verna or A. phalloides the
only thing that can be done is to meet the indications in the individual
case. If the heart is beating slowly, atropine should be given in liberal
doses. This will not overcome the chief disturbance of the circulation,
viz., the tremendous dilation of the blood vessels. Strychnia will do
this to a certain extent, but its use may be contra-indicated by twitchings
or convulsions from the toadstools. If it can be used it is exceedingly
valuable, as it stimulates not only the vaso-motor center but the
respiration and heart as well. Caffein or strong coffee may also be used
to this end if the stomach will retain it. Suprarenal extract should
also be given hypodermatically, as it will restore the blood pressure more
nearly to normal than any other drug, according to our experiments.
It has the advantage of not increasing the excitability of the spinal cord
as strychnia does, and hence would not be contra-indicated by nervous
symptoms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the most rational treatment to meet the most serious condition
of the poisoning by these toadstools is the transfusion of normal
saline solution (.6-.7 per cent. solution of table salt) into the subcutaneous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>tissues. This should, of course, only be given by a physician,
as great care is required in sterilizing the syringe. It can be given with
a fountain syringe and aspirating needle beneath the skin of the thigh.
Large quantities should be used—at least a quart (1000 cc.) or more.
The fluid is rapidly absorbed by the lymphatics and gets into the blood
vessels. It restores the blood pressure by increasing the fluid in the
vessels and also doubtless aids the organs of excretion in eliminating the
poison; at the same time it would relieve the intense thirst patients
complain of. Clinicians who have observed cases of poisoning by the
A. phalloides in man have suggested this procedure as the most rational
one to meet the symptoms presented. From the condition produced
in animals poisoned by this toadstool the writer was led to the same
conclusion. In two experiments upon dogs, when transfusion of warm
physiological salt solution was made directly into the vein after poisoning
by the A. phalloides, death occurred in both cases and the lethal
dose was not unusually large, although the amount transferred was equal
to the estimated volume of the blood of the animal in one case and half
that amount in another. In another animal atropine was given before
the poison and the pressure had been reduced by the latter to one-fifth
of the normal, the transfusion of an amount of normal salt solution
equivalent to two-thirds of the bulk of blood restored the pressure to
three-fourths of normal in about 15 minutes, but further injection of the
poison caused late death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the rise of pressure is not so great from transfusion as from
suprarenal extract in large doses, it is more <em>permanent</em>. Transfusion
(or transfusion into the subcutaneous tissues by hypodermoclysis which
amounts to the same thing) has the additional advantage of increasing
the flow of urine, which is often suppressed in these cases. Even if it
does no good it can do no harm if done antiseptically and should be
tried but <em>always in conjunction with other remedies</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A remarkable case of recovery after the injection of a large amount
of normal saline solution has been reported by Delobel (Presse medicale
September 30, 1899). A man aged fifty-two ate some A. phalloides;
he was seen four hours afterward. The skin was covered with cold,
clammy sweat; body temperature was sub-normal; shivering and
tremors present; had not vomited or purged; urine suppressed; respiration
stertorous; pulse 28 per minute and so feeble that it was almost
imperceptible. Two full doses of atropine were given hypodermatically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>as well as 10 cc. of ether and 200 cc. of strong coffee with 20 cc. of
rum were given by the mouth and hot bottles applied externally. In
spite of all this the symptoms became worse and the patient sank into a
condition of profound collapse, the pulse dropping to 24 per minute
and the tremors ceased. One liter (1 quart) of normal saline solution
was injected hypodermatically and improvement began in 15 minutes
after the injection. The respiration lost the Cheyne-Stokes character;
the pulse improved in tension and in an hour was 60 per minute; the
skin improved and the temperature returned to normal and the patient
went to work next day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The circulatory symptoms are most prominent and demand most
attention. Vomiting and purging have to be treated according to the
conditions in the individual case and no rule can be followed. As the
peripheral vessels are dilated the body temperature is usually subnormal.
This should be overcome by applying hot bottles externally.</p>

<p class='c000'>The suppression of urine should receive attention, and the activity of
the kidneys be stimulated as much as possible. It is probable the suppression
is largely due to the tremendous fall of blood pressure. If the
urine is secreted but retained in the bladder it should be drawn off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as there is no simple way of detecting the presence of poisonous
mushrooms in a mixture of mushrooms, so there is no simple way of
destroying or removing the poisons. Pouchet stated that boiling destroyed
the poison and Chestnut has stated the poison of A. phalloides
is a toxic albumen. If this were the case boiling would destroy it. In
our experiments, however, boiling has not diminished the toxicity at
all and it can be definitely stated that the poison is <em>not</em> an albumen.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is also a popular impression that vinegar will remove the poison
and numerous observers claim to have removed the poison of A. muscaria
completely by soaking the fungus in vinegar. We have not had
the opportunity of trying this with fresh A. muscaria, but in one experiment
in which the A. verna was soaked over night in vinegar it failed
to get rid of the poison—any more than would have dissolved in that
amount of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toadstool poisoning differs from most poisonings in the long time
elapsing before death in fatal cases. The only inorganic poisons causing
death after such a long interval produce profound tissue changes.
Husemann believed death from poisonous mushrooms to be due to fatty
degeneration of the various organs. We have examined microscopically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>the tissue of dogs and cats dying from the <em>late</em> effects of the A. muscaria
and A. phalloides and found them to be perfectly normal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. V.K. Chestnut, in a bulletin published by the United States
Department of Agriculture (Circular No. 13, p. 23), states that death
from the A. phalloides is due to a destruction of the red-blood corpuscles.
Upon what authority this assertion is made is not stated. The
conclusion has probably been based upon the venosity of the blood in
cases of poisoning resulting from the disturbance of the respiration and
circulation. The blood corpuscles of animals poisoned by all three of
the Amanitæ studied have been counted repeatedly in our experiments
and in <em>none of them has there been any appreciable reduction</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It can be positively stated that death is not due to a destruction of
the red blood cells.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further, the coloring matter of the blood (hæmoglobin), which carries
oxygen to the tissues, has been examined with the spectroscope to
see if any new compound had been formed which would prevent it from
carrying oxygen. No such compound has been found—no alteration
could be detected in the hæmoglobin. It is quite evident that these
toadstools do not kill by their action on the blood, for in a number of
experiments the blood was examined a very short time before death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thinking that they might act upon the nerve cells of the brain and
spinal cord very much as certain toxins of infectious diseases do, those
structures were examined by special staining methods (silver impregnation),
but no greater variation than is normal could be detected in any
of those examined.</p>

<p class='c000'>No statement can be made as to the cause of this late death, but it
would appear to be due to some disturbance of nutrition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late death occurs not only in animals, but in most of the cases of
poisoning in man recorded in medical literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The contrast between the early and late symptoms is not so great in
poisoning by A. phalloides and A. verna as in the case of poisoning by
A. muscaria. In the first two the serious symptoms appear early and
continue till the end; in the last the early effects of the muscarine soon
passes off or can be removed by atropine, but the late symptoms, strikingly
in contrast with the early ones, still appear, and continue till death.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Preparing toadstools for the table should begin while collecting them.
Have a soft brush, a knife, half a dozen one or two-pound paper bags
and an open-topped, roomy, shallow basket. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Collecting. Cleansing.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>As edible species are
found, cut them loose well above their attachment. Keep
the spore surface down until the top is brushed clean and
every particle of dirt removed from the stem. This prevents dirt from
getting upon the spore surface, from which it is very hard to dislodge.
Never clean a toadstool over other toadstools. If the stem is hard,
tough or wormy, remove it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having cleaned the plant, place it in one of the paper bags, spore
surface down. Write its name on the bag. Place but one kind in the
same bag, unless species of about the same texture and flavor are found
and mixing is not objectionable. Where another species is found, give
it a bag to itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Select fresh, inviting plants only. Do all possible cleaning in the
field. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Selection<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Plants keep clean, pack better, and more of them
can be carried. A careless jumble is gritty, bruised
and disappointing.</p>

<p class='c000'>If not ready to cook the find, place the bags in the ice chest. It is
best to cook fungi as soon as possible. Cooked, they can be kept much
longer than when uncooked.</p>

<p class='c000'>When ready to cook, wash the plants by throwing them into a deep
pan of water. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Washing.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Pass the fingers quietly through them
upward; let stand a moment for the dirt to settle, then
gather them from the water with the fingers as a drain. Remove any
scurf or adhering dirt with a coarse flannel or a cloth. Wash in this way
through two or three waters. Lay to drain. By experience in draining,
exactly the amount of water necessary to cook a particular species
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>can be allowed to remain within its spore surface, if it is a gilled species.
To other kinds, water must usually be added.</p>

<p class='c000'>The removal of the skin of any toadstool is seldom justifiable. As
with the apple and most fruits, the largest amount of flavor is in the
skin.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the consistency of the species in hand, decide upon the best
method of cooking it and the time and medium required. If it is thin,
juicy, tender, from five to ten minutes' slow stewing will be ample; if
it is thick, dry, tough, from thirty to forty minutes will be required.
After any species is cooked tender, it may be seasoned to one’s liking
and served as one chooses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many species, which absolutely refuse to become tender after prolonged
stewing, quickly succumb in the frying pan and make crisp, delicate
morsels. Edible kinds which dry well, or are hard when found, often
grate or powder easily, and are excellent (after soaking) made into
soups, fritters or pâtés.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hundreds upon hundreds of recipes for cooking the common mushroom
and the few other fungi heretofore eaten, are at hand. The
simpler methods—those which retain the natural flavor of the species
cooked—are the best.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a species has good body, and but little flavor, it may be made
delicious by cooking with it another species of higher flavor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most concise instruction is: Cook in any way you can cook an
oyster.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer’s best and long-tried recipes are here given. Mrs. Sarah
Tyson Rorer has kindly contributed some of her own choice methods;
Mrs. Emma P. Ewing, of culinary celebrity, is represented; and that
every recipe needed may be found herein, the most sensible of English
and French recipes are given.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>TO COOK MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Gather mushrooms whenever they can be found. That is the best
time of the day to collect them. The gills grow darker and the flavor
improves as the spores ripen. They are in good condition up to the
time the gills begin to grow moist and to soften.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cut off the extreme butt of the stem, holding the gills downward.
Rub off the cap and stem with a rough towel or flannel. Do not peel.
Wash in cold water. Drain well, gills downward.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>The English method is to scald them, but there is more of custom
than use in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mushrooms may be preserved temporarily by boiling them in salt
and water for five minutes, draining and wiping dry. A better way is
to cook them, place in ice-chest, and reheat when wanted.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>McIlvaine.</cite></div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To Broil.</span>—Use well-spread caps only. Use double iron broiler.
Place the caps on it, gills down, and broil two minutes, turn and broil
two minutes more. While hot, season with salt and pepper, and butter
well, especially upon the gill side. Serve upon toast.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>Mrs. S.T. Rorer.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>BAKED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Bake under a glass or basin, on toast along with scalded or clotted
cream or a little melted butter, and salt and pepper to taste. They
take about a quarter of an hour in a gentle oven or before a fire; when
they are taken up, do not remove glass for a few minutes; by that time
the vapor will have condensed and gone into the toast.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>Stevens.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>CRUSTS OF MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Cut into small, even-sized squares a pint of the selected toadstool;
stew in a little water until done; add two ounces butter and one teaspoonful
of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Wet a teaspoonful of
flour with two gills of cream and mix with the beaten yolks of two eggs.
Add, and mix well with the toadstool.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cut the upper crust from some small French rolls. Scoop out the
inside of both upper and lower part, brush them with melted butter and
brown in the oven; fill them, put on the top. Serve.</p>

<p class='c000'>Or, when cooked as directed, serve in paper cases, or pastry shells.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>TO DRY MUSHROOMS. (English method.)</h3>

<p class='c026'>Take those neither very young nor very old. Remove the butts only.
Then slice, string or skewer the slices lightly, and expose to a current
of warm dry air. A warm oven, with the door open, is a good place.
When quite dry and shrivelled, pack in tins, with spice at top and bottom.
When wanted for use, soak the slices in tepid water for some
hours. Then cook.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>STEWED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c026'>Cut the mushrooms—caps and stems—into pieces of equal size. Place
in a covered saucepan. To each pint add one ounce (two level tablespoonfuls)
of butter. Enough water will have been retained by the gills
after washing to make sufficient liquor. Stew slowly twenty minutes;
season to taste with pepper and salt. Place upon toast.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>McIlvaine.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>TO FRY MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Lay them in a frying pan in which butter has been heated boiling
hot. After frying five minutes serve on a hot dish—pouring over them
the sauce made by thickening the butter with a little flour. This is as
delicious as more elaborate ways of cooking and retains the mushroom’s
distinctive flavor in full perfection.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>FRICASSE OF MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Wash, put them into a chafing dish, sprinkle over a teaspoonful of
salt, a quarter of a teaspoonful of black pepper, cover and cook slowly
for five minutes. Moisten a tablespoonful of flour in a gill of milk,
strain this into the mushrooms, bring to boiling point, add the yolks of
two eggs slightly beaten, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and serve
at once.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>Mrs. S.T. Rorer.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>MUSHROOM PICKLES.</h3>

<p class='c026'>One-half peck of either Agaricus campester, Lepiota procera, Hypholoma
fascicularis, Hypholoma perplexum, Clitocybe multiceps,
Russula virescens. Select sound specimens, cut off ends of stems
(entire stem of fascicularis or procerus), rub the tops with flannel
dipped in salt. Throw them into milk and water (one-fourth milk).
Drain and put them into a stew pan. Sprinkle the layers with salt—one-half
gill to one-half peck mushrooms. Cover them close and put
them over a gentle fire for five minutes to draw out the water. Then
put them on a coarse cloth and drain until cold (or put on mosquito
netting in a colander).</p>

<p class='c000'>To prepare a pickle for them: Take one-half gallon vinegar (if strong
dilute with water), two ounces mace, one-fourth ounce cloves, one-half
pound salt (Worcester), one teaspoonful red pepper, one nutmeg cut
in slices.</p>

<p class='c000'>Put in a jar covered with a wet cloth and keep the cloth wet. Place
over a very slow fire, cook as long as the acid is prominent <em>and no longer</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>Take small wide-mouthed bottles, fill with the mushrooms, pour on
the pickle until the bottle is filled. Tie down tight. (To slice a nutmeg,
boil it in vinegar—slice while hot. Makes of salt vary in strength;
the “Worcester” is a strong salt.)</p>

<p class='c000'>N.B.—When H. fascicularis is used, wipe the tops with a wet cloth.</p>

seeds and seal hermetically.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>Hay.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>MUSHROOM CATCHUP.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Take the opened toadstools, clean carefully, bruise them. Put a
layer on the bottom of an earthen pan, strew salt over them (two
tablespoonfuls to one-fourth peck), another layer, more salt and so on.
One-half ounce cloves, one-half ounce mace, one-half ounce allspice,
one-half ounce whole pepper. Let stand six days. Stir every day.
Then put in gentle oven, cover pan with wet cloth, keep wet, and heat
for four hours. Strain through a fine cloth or sieve. To every gallon
of liquor add one quart red wine. Salt to taste. Add a race or two
of ginger cut small. Strain; let catchup get cold. Pour it from the
settlings. Bottle. Cork tight.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>McIlvaine.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>MUSHROOM CATCHUP.</h3>

<p class='c026'>A catchup superior to that sold in the stores may be made at home.
Break the toadstools into bits and place in a stone jar, with an ounce
and a half of salt for every quart of plants. Let stand in a cool place
for three days, stirring several times a day. On the third day put over
the fire, in a porcelain kettle, and heat slowly. In about half an hour
the juice will flow freely, when strain through a hair sieve, return to the
fire and boil twenty minutes. Measure the liquid and to each quart
allow an ounce of ginger root, a blade of mace, a bay leaf, a pinch of
cayenne, and an ounce each of allspice and black pepper; boil down to
one-half the quantity, add a teaspoonful of the best brandy to each
half-pint. Bottle. Cork and seal with wax or rosin.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>MUSHROOM CATCHUP. (English style.)</h3>
</div>

<p class='c026'>Remove the butts. Sprinkle all with salt. Pile in a bowl. Let
them remain so for three days, stirring occasionally. Then squeeze
out all the liquor. To each gallon of it add cloves and mustard seed,
crushed, of each half an ounce; allspice, peppercorns and ginger,
crushed, of each one ounce. Heat slowly up to boiling point in a
covered vessel. Set aside in a warm place for a fortnight. Then strain
and bottle. If the catchup shows signs of not keeping, add more salt
and spice, heat and proceed as before.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>CANNED MUSHROOM SAUCE.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Cook together, until a light brown color, two tablespoonfuls each of
butter and flour, add a can of button mushrooms, with the water it contains,
and a cupful of water or broth. Simmer five minutes, stirring
meanwhile, season and serve. The flavor of the mushroom is more distinct
and pronounced if the sauce is seasoned only with salt and mixed
pepper. If broth is used in the preparation of mushroom sauce instead
of water, it should be the broth of such meat as the sauce is to be
served with—for instance, chicken broth when to be served with chicken,
beef broth when to be served with beef, etc.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>Mrs. Emma P. Ewing.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>FRESH MUSHROOM SAUCE.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Put in a graniteware or porcelain-lined saucepan two tablespoonfuls

<p class='c026'>To one pint of any well-cooked toadstool of meaty species, add two
hard-boiled eggs, a sprig of parsley; pepper and salt to taste; chop all
very fine, then take two level tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour,
put over the fire with the toadstools and eggs; mix thoroughly together,

<h3 class='c025'>TO COOK FISTULINA HEPATICA.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Mrs. Hussey says of it: “If it is not beef itself, it is sauce for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It can be sliced thin and dressed as a salad with mayonnaise dressing
or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The simplest and best way is to cut the fungus into slices as one
would egg-plant. If it is small, slice it into two parts, fry in hot butter,
season with pepper and salt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another favorite way is to slice the plant across the grain, cut into
squares of one-half inch and cook very slowly in a covered pan for
twenty minutes. Add a little water, and plenty of butter. Season with
pepper and salt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The F. hepatica always has a slightly acid taste, which is very

<h3 class='c025'>TO BROIL ANY CAPPED FUNGUS.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Select those that are spread open and keep the unopened for other
styles of serving. Cut off the stems close to the tops. Baste well with
melted butter and sprinkle lightly with pepper and salt. Heat the broiler
very hot, lay the caps upon it with the gills up and broil over a clear fire,
turning the broiler first on one side and then on the other. As soon as
tender, which will be in about five minutes, open the broiler, remove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>the caps with care, and place on well-buttered slices of the toast which
have been previously prepared. Pour over the whole a sauce made of
drawn butter, or hot water thickened with flour to the consistency of
cream.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>FRIED TOADSTOOLS.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Take the caps only—one pint—well drained and carefully seasoned
with one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful black pepper. Place
in a pan with one ounce of butter (a lump the size of a small egg).
Fry slowly for ten minutes. Add a little milk or cream thickened with
flour. Serve on hot toast.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>TO COOK HYDNUM.</h3>

<p class='c026'>In cooking Hydnei care must be taken to cook slowly and well.</p>

<p class='c000'>Use the tender parts only of stems and caps of the capped species,
and soft, fresh parts of the maned species; cut into small pieces of
similar size, stew slowly in covered saucepan for from thirty to forty
minutes, season with butter, pepper and salt. Serve.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>TO COOK HYPHOLOMAS.</h3>

<p class='c026'><span class='sc'>To Stew.</span>—Wash the caps, stew slowly in the water which the gills
retain, for half an hour, keeping dish covered. Add plenty of butter,
pepper and salt to taste, add cream or milk with a little thickening.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hypholomas have a slightly bitter taste, of which most persons
become very fond; if it is objectionable, add a small amount of lemon
juice or sherry.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_648'>648</span>SALADS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Many species of fungi make good salads. The best of these are,
Russulæ when young, fresh and firm; either sliced raw or stewed and
drained; Clitocybe multiceps stewed and drained; Tricholoma personatum,
raw or stewed; Clitopilus prunulus, raw or stewed; Coprinus
comatus, C. micaceus, atramentarius, raw; Clavaria, fresh, young, brittle,
either raw or stewed; Fistulina hepatica, raw; any of the edible
Polyporaceæ, after stewing; any of the edible Hydnaceæ after stewing;
the puff-balls, raw or stewed. Any favorite species will make a salad.</p>

<p class='c000'>After cooking allow to drain and cool; then mix with mayonnaise
dressing, or make a dressing to taste of oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.
Serve on lettuce.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>SOUP.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Dame Nature never made a soup. Soup is a human invention of
more or less distinctiveness. Usually it is a successful disguise or covering
of invisibility for something which furnishes the name.</p>

<p class='c000'>To make two quarts of a distinctly fungoid soup take one quart of
any edible toadstools, carefully cleaned. Put in a well-covered boiler
with three pints of water, and boil slowly for one hour. Rub the whole
through a colander. Reject that which does not rub through readily.
Add one-half pint of milk thickened with one tablespoonful of flour,
one ounce of butter, a dessertspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of pepper.
Bring to a boil. Serve.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any chosen thing or things may be added to the above—the toadstools
can not resent it.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>McIlvaine.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>TOADSTOOLS WITH CHEESE.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Several varieties of fungi are delicious when baked with a small quantity
of cheese grated upon them; notably Clitocybe multiceps, the
Hypholomas, Armillarias, Pleurotus ulmarius and ostreatus, Lentinus
lepideus and many Boleti. See recipe for baking. When several layers
of plants compose the dish, cheese should be grated on each layer.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>McIlvaine.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>BAKED TOADSTOOLS OF ANY GILLED KIND.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Wash, place the caps in a tightly covered dish or pan after dipping
them in bread crumbs. Lay them in layers, with a small piece of
butter on each toadstool, as well as the proper amount of pepper and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_649'>649</span>salt. Bake from twenty to forty minutes as suits the consistency of the
species. Serve on toast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Or, the caps prepared as above, may be laid upon pieces of toast and
placed in the pan. If this plan is adopted the lower pieces of toast
become saturated with the liquor; therefore, in serving, cut from top to
bottom of dish.</p>

<div class='c018'><cite>McIlvaine.</cite></div>

<h3 class='c025'>A CAMP BAKE.</h3>

<p class='c026'>Cover the bottom of a tin plate with caps, spore surface up. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper, place a bit of butter on each. Put another tin
plate on top. Set on coals or a heated stone for fifteen minutes. Eat.
No better baking will result in the best oven.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>PREFATORY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The first edition of “One Thousand American Fungi” so fully
embodied the species known to be edible, that the field for fresh investigation
has been confined principally to newly discovered species. In
the eighteen months elapsing since the publication of the first edition,
Professor Charles H. Peck—the American authority upon fungi—has
reported several. These, with his descriptions, are named in the supplement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The many requests made of the author for information upon the
raising of mushrooms show a prevalent interest in the industry. What
he knows is stated herein; what he does not know, and what is not
known upon the subject, would furnish the matter for a volume.</p>

<p class='c000'>Interest in the study of fungi is well established and is rapidly increasing.
This department of botany has been made a specialty in
many colleges and schools. Its importance is everywhere recognized.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author and publishers feel a just pride in the success of “One
Thousand American Fungi.” The prompt sale of the first edition, and
immediate demand for the second, warrant it. Their thanks are due to
the many who have kindly interested themselves in obtaining subscriptions
to the author’s edition.</p>

<p class='c051'><strong>Amanita Frostiana pallidipes</strong> n. var. (See A. Frostiana, page <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>.)
In his report of the New York State Botanist for 1899, Prof. Charles
H. Peck describes a new variety of Amanita Frostiana as follows:</p>

<p class='c051'>The typical form of this species, which is common in our cool northern
woods, has the pileus and annulus, and usually the stem also, of a
yellow color, that of the pileus sometimes verging to orange. But in
warmer and more open or bushy places forms occur in which the whole
plant is whitish, but in other respects has the characters of the species.
Sometimes the pileus is pale-yellow and the stem and annulus white.
The warts are soft and flocculent, are sometimes numerous and persistent,
and again are few or wanting. The form with yellow stem and
annulus and yellow or orange pileus may be considered the typical form
of the species, but forms having the stem and annulus pale or white
may be designated as variety pallidipes. <cite>Peck,</cite> 53d Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.</p>

<p class='c051'>Undoubtedly POISONOUS. <cite>McIlvaine.</cite></p>

<div class='sidenote c028'>Lepiota.</div>
<p class='c051'><strong>Lepiota Morgani</strong> Pk. (See page <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>.) The majority of mycophagists
are immune to the poison of this species. Yet many cases of
severe, but not fatal poisoning by it came within the writer’s knowledge
during the season of 1900–1901.</p>

<p class='c051'>A valuable report is contained in a letter from George B. Clementson,
attorney, Lancaster, Wis.:</p>

<p class='c051'>“* * * Lepiota Morgani has grown in this locality this season in
unusual abundance. While I was absent last week, my father picked a
number, mistaking them for L. procera, and my mother, in preparing
them for the table, ate a small piece of the cap of one—a piece, she
assures me, no larger than a hickory nut. About two hours afterward
and shortly after dinner (at which the mushrooms were not served, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_712'>712</span>at which nothing indigestible was eaten) she experienced a peculiar
numbness and nausea, with constriction of the throat. Vomiting set in
within half an hour and was excessive, lasting several hours and giving
no relief. She was very greatly weakened and thought herself dying,
being so reduced at one time that she was unable to see. Purging set
in not long after the vomiting. The constriction of the throat did not
disappear until after the vomiting stopped.</p>

<p class='c051'>“Whisky and nitroglycerine (by the stomach) were given to keep
up the heart’s action.</p>

<p class='c051'>“It seems probable that the poison itself did not directly affect the
heart, but that the alarming weakness was due to the vomiting and
purging. That is my mother’s own opinion. After being in bed for a
day she was able to get around, but suffered considerable pain in the
abdomen for forty-eight hours.</p>

<p class='c051'>“I presume that owing to the fact that my mother is not very strong
and has a weak stomach, she was more violently affected than many
might be. But a poison that in any person can produce such symptoms,
when taken in so small a quantity, ought to be labeled decidedly
dangerous.</p>

<p class='c051'>“There can be no question that the specimens were L. Morgani, as
I examined some that were left of those picked, and also gathered
others from the same patch where these were obtained.</p>

<p class='c051'>“As everything relating to mushroom poisoning should be of interest
to the mycologist and mycophagist, I take the liberty of reporting this
case.”</p>

<p class='c051'>The Lepiota Morgani appears to be spreading. In 1901 I found
large specimens of it outside a stable in Lebanon, Pa. Its appearance
and luxuriance are so much in its favor, that the toadstool lover will be
tempted to try it. Experiments in eating it should be conducted with
the greatest caution.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c051'><strong>Lepiota clypeolaria</strong> (Bull.) Fr. Shield Lepiota. (Plate <a href='#applate002'>II</a>.) <strong>Pileus</strong>
thin, soft, convex or subcampanulate, becoming nearly plane, obtuse or
umbonate, squamose, whitish or yellowish, the center or umbo smooth,
yellowish or brownish, the margin often appendiculate with fragments of
the veil. <strong>Flesh</strong> white. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> thin, close, free, white. <strong>Stem</strong> slender,
equal or slightly tapering upward, hollow, fragile, pallid, adorned with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_713'>713</span>soft, loose, white or yellowish floccose scales or filaments. <strong>Spores</strong>
oblong or subfusiform, 12–20µ long, 6–8µ broad.</p>

<p class='c051'>The cap of the shield lepiota is at first somewhat ovate or bell-shaped,
but with advancing age it becomes
convex above or nearly flat. It is
white or whitish, but spotted with
numerous small scales of a yellowish
or brownish-yellow color. These
scales are the result of the breaking
up of the thin cuticle that covers the
very young plant, and they have the
same color as it. A small space in
the center is brown or yellowish-brown,
or darker than the rest of the
cap, because the cuticle covering it
remains unbroken and retains its
color. The center in some specimens
is more prominent than in others,
giving what is called an umbonate
cap. The margin of the cap is sometimes shaggy, specially in
young plants, by the adhering fragments of the whitish veil.</p>

<p class='c051'>The gills are thin, closely placed side by side and rounded at the
end next the stem, but they are not attached to the stem. They are
white. The stem is rather long and slender, fragile and adorned with
loose, soft fibrils or flocculent, cottony tufts, which give it a somewhat
shaggy appearance, but it becomes smoother as the plant grows older.</p>

<p class='c051'>The cap is usually from 1–2.5 inches broad, and the stem from 1.5–3
inches long and 1.5–3 lines thick. The plants grow in woods, specially
in hilly and mountainous regions, and are generally solitary or few in a
place, but in favorable seasons they are of frequent occurrence and may
be found from July to October. Though small and thin, the caps are
well flavored and make a desirable dish. <em>L. metulaespora</em> B. and Br.
scarcely differs from this species, except in the striate margin of its cap.

<p class='c056'><strong>Lepiota naucinoides</strong> Pk. (See page <a href='#Page_45'>45</a>.) This valuable food
species is spreading and rapidly increasing in many of the states. Prof.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_714'>714</span>Charles H. Peck, in 54th Annual Report of the New York State Museum,
says of it: “It has shown considerable variability in some of its
characters. Usually its pileus is very white and smooth, clean and attractive,
but specimens have been found this year having the pileus
dingy or smoky brown, others have been seen in which the cuticle of
the pileus was cracked in such a way as to form minute squamules, and
in one or two instances plants were observed having the surface of the
pileus adorned with minute granules, a character attributed to <em>L. naucina</em>
Fr. In such cases the importance of recognizing the spore characters
is shown. By disregarding this character our plant has sometimes
been referred to <em>L. naucina</em> and sometimes to <em>Agaricus cretaceus</em> Fr.,
both of which it closely resembles, and with which it appears to be confused
by European mycologists, some referring it to one species and
some to the other.”</p>

<p class='c051'>The species named are equally excellent.</p>

young, with the margin incurved,
becoming pale ochraceous with age
and often squamose or rimosely areolate.
<strong>Flesh</strong> white, taste mild, odor
like that of mushrooms. <strong>Lamellæ</strong>
thin, close, slightly or strongly decurrent,
forked or anastomosing at
the base, white. <strong>Stem</strong> usually short,
equal or slightly tapering upward,
solid, white. <strong>Spores</strong> broadly elliptic,
6–8µ long, 5µ broad.</p>

<p class='c051'><strong>Pileus</strong> 1–4 inches broad. <strong>Stem</strong>
1–3 inches long, 4–12 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c051'>Gregarious or cespitose. Woods, especially of pine. When growing
in tufts the stem is often eccentric and the pileus irregular. The
base of the stem is often white tomentose. Its agreeable odor and
mild taste led to a trial of its edible qualities, but it developed a bitter
taste in cooking. <cite>Peck</cite>, 54th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c056'><span class='pageno' id='Page_715'>715</span><strong>Clitocybe Adirondackensis</strong> Pk. Adirondack Clitocybe. <strong>Pileus</strong>

<strong>Lamellæ</strong> thin, narrow, close, very decurrent, white. <strong>Stem</strong> nearly
equal, glabrous, stuffed or hollow, colored like the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> subglobose
or broadly elliptic, 4–5µ long, 3–4µ broad.</p>

<p class='c051'>The Adirondack clitocybe is common in the northern forests of the
state, but is not limited to them. Its cap is thin, and soon becomes
nearly flat with a decurved margin and a central depression or umbilicus,
or very concave by the elevation of the margin, and then it resembles
a wineglass in shape. Its margin is sometimes wavy or irregular.
In color it varies from white to a very pale red or tan color. White
specimens sometimes have the center slightly darker than the rest.</p>

<p class='c051'>The gills are very narrow, being scarcely broader than the thickness
of the flesh of the cap. They are closely placed, white and decurrent.</p>

<p class='c051'>The stem is nearly cylindric, smooth and stuffed or hollow. It is colored
like the cap. Often there is a white tomentum or cottony substance
at its base.</p>

<p class='c051'>The cap varies in size and is 1–2 inches broad; the stem 1.5–3 inches
long and 1–2 lines thick. It may be found from July to October. Its
flavor is suggestive of that of the common mushroom. <cite>Peck</cite>, 54th

<p class='c056'><strong>Clitocybe maculosa</strong> Pk. Spotted Clitocybe. <strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, convex,
often centrally depressed, glabrous, centrally marked with numerous
small round spots, yellowish-white, the young margin involute and
minutely downy. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, taste mild. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> narrow, close,
very decurrent, whitish or slightly yellowish, some of them forked.
<strong>Stem</strong> equal or slightly tapering upward, glabrous or sparingly fibrillose,
stuffed, sometimes becoming hollow, whitish. <strong>Spores</strong> subglobose or
orbicular, 4–5µ broad.</p>

<p class='c051'>The peculiar mark by which the spotted clitocybe may be distinguished
consists in the small round definite spots in the central part of
the cap. They have a slightly darker or watery or yellowish color and
appear as if depressed below the rest of the surface. The cap is smooth
and whitish or yellowish white and is generally depressed in the center
and decurved on the margin. The margin is usually adorned with
slight, short radiating ridges. The flesh is white and the taste mild.</p>

<p class='c051'><span class='pageno' id='Page_716'>716</span>The gills are closely placed side by side, narrow and prolonged
downward on the stem. They have nearly the same color as the cap.
The stem is nearly cylindric, smooth or adorned with a few silky fibrils,
whitish and spongy within or sometimes hollow when old.</p>

<p class='c051'>The cap is from 1–3 inches broad; the stem 2–3 inches long and
2–4 lines thick. This mushroom grows among fallen leaves in woods.
It appears in August and September. I have found it in the Adirondack
forests only. Its range is probably northward, and its rarity detracts
from its importance as an edible species. <cite>Peck</cite>, 54th Rep. N.Y.

<p class='c051'>I had not seen this species when the
first edition of this work went to press,
consequently could not report its edible
qualities. The favorable testing by Professor
Peck adds weight to the opinion
I have frequently expressed, that acridity
of species when raw is no evidence
whatever that they are harmful. Acridity usually disappears in cooking.</p>

<p class='c056'><span class='pageno' id='Page_717'>717</span><strong>Lactarius distans</strong> Pk. Distant-gilled Lactarius. <strong>Pileus</strong> firm,
broadly convex or nearly plane, umbilicate or slightly depressed in the
center, with a minute velvety pruinosity, yellowish tawny or brownish
orange. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> rather broad, distant, adnate or slightly decurrent,
white or creamy yellow, the interspaces venose, milk white, mild.
<strong>Stem</strong> short, equal or tapering downward, solid, pruinose, colored like
the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> subglobose. 9–11µ broad.</p>

<p class='c051'>The distant-gilled Lactarius is similar to the orange Lactarius in
color, but in other respects it is quite distinct. The short stem, widely
separated gills and pruinose surface of the cap are distinctive features.
The cap is broadly convex and often has a small central depression or
umbilicus. In some cases it becomes nearly plane or even slightly funnel-shape
by the spreading or elevation of the margin. The surface,
specially in young and in well-developed specimens, has a soft pruinose
or almost velvety appearance to the naked eye, and when viewed
through a magnifying glass it is seen to be covered with minute persistent
granules. The surface is sometimes wrinkled and frequently it
cracks in such a way as to form small angular or irregular areas.
The color is a peculiar one, varying somewhat in shade, but with tawny
hues prevailing. It has been described as yellowish tawny and brownish
orange. The flesh is white or whitish and has a mild taste.</p>

<p class='c051'>The gills are wide apart, somewhat arched in specimens having a convex
cap and slightly decurrent in those with fully expanded or centrally
depressed caps. Their color is white or creamy yellow and in
old and dried specimens they have a white pruinosity as if frosted by
the spores. The milk is white and mild.</p>

<p class='c051'>The stem is short, rarely more than an inch long, and is cylindric or
tapering downward. It is solid and colored and clothed like the cap.</p>

<p class='c051'>The cap is 1 to 4 in. broad; the stem is usually about 1 in. long, 4
to 8 lines thick. It is found in thin woods, bushy places and pastures
from July to September. It is similar to the orange Lactarius, <em>L. volemus</em>,
in its edible qualities. <cite>Peck</cite>, 52d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.</p>

<p class='c056'><strong>Russula rugulosa</strong> n. sp. Rugulose Russula. <strong>Pileus</strong> rather thin,
fragile, convex, becoming nearly plane or centrally depressed, viscid
when moist, roughened or uneven with small tubercles and rugæ, even
on the margin when young, becoming tuberculate striate with age, the
viscid pellicle separable on the margin. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, reddish under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_718'>718</span>cuticle, taste tardily acrid. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> rather close, adnate or slightly
rounded behind, white. <strong>Stem</strong> nearly equal, spongy within, white.
<strong>Spores</strong> white, rough, subglobose, 8–10µ broad, shining in transmitted
light.</p>

<p class='c051'>The rugulose russula is closely related to the emetic russula, but differs
from it in the uneven or rugulose surface of the cap, in the tardily
acrid taste and in its closer adnate gills. Its cap is red, varying from
pale-red to dark-red, viscid when moist, even on the margin when
young, but somewhat tuberculate and striate when old. Its surface is
roughened by minute tubercles or pimples, which sometimes appear to
run together and form short ridges. These are sometimes absent from
the center of the cap. The viscid cuticle easily peels from the margin
of the cap, but not from the center. The flesh is white, except just
under the cuticle, where it is reddish. It is soft and fragile, and its
taste is slowly and much less sharply acrid than in the emetic russula.
Its gills are closely placed, attached to the stem and persistently white.
The stem is brittle, soft and spongy within, smooth and white. The
cap is 2–4 inches broad, the stem 2–3 inches long, 4–8 lines thick.</p>

<p class='c051'>It grows in woods among mosses and fallen leaves or on the bare
ground, and appears in August and September. It is an inhabitant of
the Adirondack forests. Its slightly acrid flavor is destroyed in cooking,
and it affords a harmless, tender and agreeable food. <cite>Peck</cite>, 54th

<p class='c056'><strong>Russula abietina</strong> n. sp. Fir Tree Russula. <strong>Pileus</strong> thin, fragile,
convex, becoming nearly plane or slightly depressed in the center,
viscid when moist, the viscid pellicle separable, tuberculate striate on
the margin. <strong>Flesh</strong> white, taste mild. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> subdistant, ventricose,
narrowed toward the stem, rounded behind and nearly free, whitish,
becoming pale yellow, the interspaces venose. <strong>Stem</strong> equal or
tapering toward the top, stuffed or hollow, white. <strong>Spores</strong> bright yellowish
ochraceous, subglobose, rough, 8–10µ broad.</p>

<p class='c051'>The fir tree russula is closely related to the youthful russula, <em>R. puellaris</em>
Fr., from which it is separated by the viscid cap, the gills rather
widely separated from each other and nearly free, the stem never yellowish
nor becoming yellow where wounded, and the spores having an
ochraceous hue. They are much brighter and more highly colored in
the mass than the mature gills. The cap varies much in color, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_719'>719</span>center is generally darker than the rest. It may be dull purple or
greenish purple with a brownish or blackish center, or sometimes with an
olive green center, or it may be olive green or smoky green with a
brownish center. Olive green and purplish hues of various shades are
variously combined, but sometimes the margin is grayish and the center
olive green. The flesh is white and its taste mild. The gills are white
when young, or barely tinged with yellow, but they become pale yellow
with age. They are neither crowded nor widely attached to the
stem, and are connected with each other by cross veins, which can be
seen at the bottom of the interspaces. The stems are rather slender,
soft or spongy, sometimes becoming hollow and occasionally tapering
upward. They are very constantly and persistently white. The <strong>cap</strong>
is 1–2.5 inches broad, the <strong>stem</strong> 1–2.5 inches long, 3–5 lines thick.
This russula grows under or near pine, spruce or balsam fir trees. It
occurs from July to October. It is tender and palatable. The stems
also are tender and may be cooked with the caps. <cite>Peck</cite>, 54th Rep. N.

This makes the stem eccentric or in some cases almost lateral. The
color is quite constant, but in some instances it is paler and approaches
a pinkish hue. It is apt to fade or even disappear in dried specimens.
The gills are blunt on the edge as in other species of this genus. They
are forked or branched, narrow and decurrent.</p>

<p class='c051'><span class='pageno' id='Page_720'>720</span>The stem is small, smooth and usually rather short. It is generally
solid, but in the original description it is characterized as stuffed. The
cap is 8 to 18 lines broad; the stem 6 to 12 lines long and 1 to 3
broad. It grows gregariously in thin woods and open places and may
be found from July to September. It sometimes occurs in great abundance,
which adds to its importance as an edible species. The fresh
plant has a tardily and slightly acrid flavor, but this disappears in cooking.
In Epicrisis, Fries referred this species to the genus Hygrophorus,
and in Sylloge also it is placed in that genus, but it is a true Cantharellus
and belongs in the genus in which Schweinitz placed it. <cite>Peck</cite>,

<p class='c056'><strong>Cortinarius corrugatus</strong> Pk. Corrugated Cortinarius. (Plate <a href='#applate006'>VI</a>.)
<strong>Pileus</strong> fleshy, broadly campanulate or very convex, viscid when moist,
coarsely corrugated, bright-yellow,
reddish-yellow, tawny or ochraceous.
<strong>Flesh</strong> white. <strong>Lamellæ</strong> close, pallid
when young, becoming tawny with
age. <strong>Stem</strong> rather long, equal, hollow,
bulbous, pallid or yellowish, the
bulb viscid and usually colored like
the pileus. <strong>Spores</strong> broadly elliptical,
rough, 11–16µ long, 8–10µ broad.</p>

<p class='c051'>The corrugated Cortinarius is a well-marked
and easily-recognized species,
quite distinct from its allies. Although
the color of the pileus is variable, its
viscid, corrugated surface and the viscid
bulb of the stem afford distinctive
and easily-recognized characters.
Sometimes the corrugations or wrinkles
anastomose with each other in
such a way as to give a reticulated
appearance. The color varies from
yellow to reddish-tawny or reddish-ochraceous.
The margin in young
plants is incurved.</p>

<p class='c051'>There is a variety in which the cap is adorned with darker-colored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_721'>721</span>spots or scales. This bears the name, variety <em>subsquamosus</em>. In all
other respects it is like the species.</p>

<p class='c051'>The gills are closely placed side by side. They are at first of a pale
hue, but assume a darker and more definite tawny color with age. They
are usually minutely uneven or eroded on the edge and transversely striate
on the sides. They are slightly narrowed toward the stem.</p>

<p class='c051'>The stem is generally a little longer than the width of the cap. It
is commonly smooth, but sometimes sprinkled near the top with minute
yellowish particles and adorned below with a few fibrils. It is hollow
and has a distinct viscid bulbous base, the viscidity of which is a peculiar
feature. This bulb in the very young plant is even broader than
the young cap, that at this stage of development appears to rest upon
it. The color of the bulb is usually like that of the cap, but the stem
is commonly paler than either.</p>

<p class='c051'>The cap is 2 to 4 inches broad, the stem 3 to 5 inches long, 3 to 8
lines thick. The plants are gregarious in woods and bushy places, and
may be found from June to September. It sometimes grows in considerable
abundance, and as an edible species it is not to be despised.

<p class='c056'><strong>Agaricus hæmorrhoidarius</strong> Schulz. Bleeding Mushroom. The
bleeding mushroom is easily recognized, when fresh, by the red color
assumed by wounds of the flesh either of the cap or stem. This character
is also found in the seashore mushroom, <em>A. maritimus</em>, a species
that has a solid stem and has not yet been found growing far from the
sea. The cap is generally some shade of brown, but sometimes when
young it is white. It is adorned with darker fibrils or scales, though
these sometimes become obscure or disappear with age. When young
it is hemispheric or very convex, but it soon becomes broadly convex or
nearly flat, with the center either slightly depressed or somewhat prominent.
The flesh is generally whitish or grayish white when first exposed
to the air. It assumes the red color rather slowly and after a
time loses it again.</p>

<p class='c051'>The gills are pink or rarely whitish when young, but become brown or
blackish brown with age. The stem is long or short, cylindric or tapering
upward, sometimes slightly thickened or bulbous at the base, sometimes
not. It is hollow, but the cavity small, at first fibrillose and
more or less adorned with floccose scales toward the base, but these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_722'>722</span>generally disappear with age, and the primary white color of the stem
is apt to become darker with age. The collar is membranaceous and
at first conceals the gills. It is persistent, silky and white or whitish,
sometimes tinged with brown.</p>

<p class='c051'>The <strong>cap</strong> is 2–4 inches broad; the <strong>stem</strong> 2–4 inches long, 3–5 lines
thick. It grows in woods or bushy places and seems to prefer damp
soil rich in vegetable mold. It may be found from August to October.
It sometimes grows in clusters. It gives to milk in which it is stewed a
brownish color. Its flavor is similar to that of the common mushroom.
A variety in which the stem is commonly shorter and the pileus of a
darker smoky brown color is sometimes abundant in low damp ground
on Long Island. It may be called <em>variety fumosus</em>. <cite>Peck</cite>, 54th Rep.

<p class='c056'><strong>Agaricus abruptus</strong> Pk. (A. silvicola Vitt., A. arvensis var. abruptus
Pk.) (Plate <a href='#applate001'>I</a>, page 722.) Agaricus abruptus Pk. is described
on page 343 as A. silvicola Vitt. It is very common in the woods of
West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1901,
I found it in Rockingham Co., N.C. The probabilities are that its
spread is extensive.</p>

<p class='c051'>Being the wood cousin of the field mushroom (A. campester) it deserves
more than ordinary attention. It is found during months which
do not favor the growth of the mushroom. It is equally good, though
not so fleshy. It gives the true mushroom flavor to less flavored edible
species when cooked with them.</p>

<p class='c051'>When seen at a distance, growing in the woods, it has the appearance
of an Amanita, but the color of the gills, which are never white after
the cap opens and become as the spores ripen a blackish brown, distinguishes
it at once. Neither has it a volva.</p>

white except just beneath the cuticle, where it is sometimes reddish.
The tubes are long and greenish yellow. They are at first nearly
plane in the mass, but with the expansion of the cap the mass often becomes
ventricose. The mouths of the tubes are small and nearly
round. Wounds or bruises of the mass become bluish or greenish blue.

  <h2 class='c004'>RAISING MUSHROOMS AT HOME</h2>
</div>

<p class='c057'>By the courtesy of the publishers of The Woman’s Home Companion, the author
is permitted to republish his article, “Raising Mushrooms at Home,” which appeared in
the October, 1901, number of that excellent monthly—encyclopedic in all home matters.</p>

In October is the time to prepare the manure and beds
for house-raising of mushrooms. During the warm
months they can not be cultivated without trial of
one’s temper and test of one’s taste. Any one having
control of a cellar can raise a fine crop of expectations,
and may raise a crop of mushrooms by either
accident or experience. They are at all times the
most contrary of growths, and require the nicest management
and much patience. The first thing to do is to select a well-ventilated
spot away from direct drafts, where the temperature can be
maintained at from fifty to sixty degrees and a moist atmosphere assured.
Thoroughly cleanse the cellar and give it an entire covering of
whitewash.</p>

<p class='c051'>Decide upon the size of bed desired. In width the bed should not
exceed reaching distance to its center when there is a pathway on each
side of it, say six feet. The length of the bed should reach to its useful
stopping-place. If the cellar has a portable heater in it, and is warm,
the bed should be ten to twelve inches in depth; if the heater is walled
in, or the cellar is cool, the bed should be fifteen inches deep.</p>

<p class='c051'>Calculate how much fresh horse-manure, with the long straw only removed
from it and that has not been rained upon, it will take to make
a bed of desired dimensions solidly tramped. Get it, put it in a compact
heap, and keep it covered from rain. It will heat rapidly and get
smoking-hot, because a fermentation sets in which produces heat. If
loam can be procured from a pasture or elsewhere it is well to add one-fifth
(in bulk) of it to the manure, mixing it thoroughly. This addition
retards the fermentation and absorbs the ammonia—a valuable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_725'>725</span>fertilizer—which would otherwise be driven off by the heat. It also takes
up any surplus of moisture.</p>

<p class='c051'>After the compact pile has been thus prepared it should stand two or
three days, then be well forked over and again piled. This forking
should be repeated from four to six times, at intervals of from two to
four days, depending upon the use or not of loam, which affects the
rapidity of heating. If loam is used the forking should be at longer intervals
unless the heat becomes excessive. The manure will probably
then be in good order to go into beds. It is upon proper, careful preparation
of this medium that successful mushroom-raising greatly depends.
All work and hopes are thrown away if the greatest care is not
exercised. Just as it is folly to buy poor seeds upon which to expend
costly labor, so it is folly to make beds of poorly prepared manure.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id046'>
<img src='images/apfig_001.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>BRICK CUT FOR PLANTING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c051'>The manure must neither contain too much nor too little water. By
far the largest percentage of failures is due to too much. It rots the
spawn vine (mycelium), and thus destroys the starting place of the
fruit, or mushroom. The object in forking the manure so frequently
is to sweeten it (as the operation is called) and to prevent overheating
from fermentation. If it gets too hot it “burns”—gets too dry.
Molding, too, is avoided. Moldy manure will not produce. If, in
forking over the pile, dry places are found, they should be sprinkled
with water; if, when the fermentation grows less active, the manure is
too wet, spread it out to air and dry somewhat. It is in good condition
and properly moist when tight squeezing will not press water from
it. Far better that it should be too dry than too wet. The manure now
ready should be moved to the cellar and made into beds while warm.</p>

<p class='c051'>Good ventilation is a necessity. Two thermometers are needed—one
to mark the temperature of the cellar, the other to place well and
solidly down in the bed to record what it is doing in the heat way. It
is probable that the mercury will rise slowly. It may go as high as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_726'>726</span>one hundred and twenty-five or one hundred and thirty degrees. Do
not disturb the bed, however high it goes. When it falls to between
ninety and eighty degrees plant the spawn. If possible, keep the temperature
up for several days. It should then fall slowly to sixty
degrees, but go down no farther. Never plant on a rising temperature.</p>

<p class='c051'>Mushroom-spawn comes in brick-shaped blocks. They can be purchased,
of good quality, from any reliable seedsman. These blocks
are made of a mixture of dungs, through which the mycelium, or vine,
from which mushrooms grow, has been run. After this mixture is filled
with the vine (badly named spawn) it is pressed into blocks and dried.
It should be kept dry until used. Spawning a bed is nothing more
than placing cuttings of this exceedingly fine vine under the influence
of moisture and heat in a soil fitted for its growth (such as the bed
should be), then inducing it to run and fruit. Spawn is originally made
to grow by planting the seed of mushrooms in specially prepared dungs
and germinating them. The mycelium, or vine, coming from this
germination is called “virgin spawn,” and is perpetuated in its growth
by running (training) it through manures, pieces of which form the
spawn of commerce.</p>

<p class='c051'>With a sharp hatchet cut the bricks into twelve pieces of equal size;
a fine, clean meat-saw may be used, as it reduces breakage. With the
hand make holes in the bed ten inches apart each way. These holes
must be so deep that when the lumps of spawn are thrust firmly down
into them the top of the lumps will be not less than one inch or more
than two inches below the surface of the bed. Cover the lumps firmly.
Have the surface of the bed as even as possible. Without having to go
very far into the cold region of mathematics, the number of bricks of
spawn needed is easily figured. Ascertain the number of holes, ten
inches apart, that can be made in the bed. Divide this number by
twelve, and lo! you have it.</p>

<p class='c051'>After the bed is spawned it is well to lay a double thickness of newspapers
over it, putting a few plastering-laths or light sticks upon them
to keep them in place. This is to keep the heat in the bed, as it is
desirable that the temperature should not run down too rapidly. It
should be two weeks falling to sixty degrees.</p>

<p class='c051'>Ten days after spawning, if the heat of the bed has gone down to
sixty-five or sixty degrees, cover the bed with two inches of loam and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_727'>727</span>pat it solid with spade or board. The bed should not be covered with
loam when the temperature is too high. Removing the papers will
allow the heat to escape. At the time of covering with loam the spawn
should have begun to spread. It will show plainly in the manure close
to the lumps of spawn. Its odor is unmistakable, being musky, spicy,
much like mushrooms, but stronger. Care should be taken not to disturb
the new mycelium, as all breakage of the fine, web-like threads
lessens its product. The mycelium should start and grow quickly up to
the time of covering with loam. After that a slow increase is best. To
effect this the surrounding outside temperature should be from fifty-seven
to sixty-two degrees. Ventilation should be upward and good,
but not directly upon the bed.</p>

<p class='c051'>The mycelium will now run and completely fill the bed. Minute
white nodules will appear upon the threads of it; these are the beginnings
of the mushrooms to come. In from seven to eight weeks after spawning
tiny button mushrooms should appear on top of the bed. If the
cellar has been cool it may be a few days longer. Mr. Falconer says,
“If the temperature of the bed falls below fifty-seven degrees, and the
atmospheric temperature below forty-five degrees, the beds should be
covered with matting or other material.” Newspapers will do. Upon
the appearance of the mushrooms is the time a moist atmosphere is
needed. This is obtained by sprinkling the walks and cellar well with
warm water. This moisture should be kept up all the while the crop is
growing. Unless the fruiting beds show a marked dryness they should
not be watered. If watering is required, do it very carefully with a
fine rose or syringe. Have the pure water at ninety degrees, and do
not more than moisten the loam covering. Never let the water settle
in pools or wash the surface.</p>

<p class='c051'>After the bed is in bearing the addition of strong, liquid manure
plentifully applied between the bunches (never on them) will add to
their weight and size. It should be done with a long spout without
rose. A sprinkling of salt on bare places is beneficial.</p>

<h3 class='c025'>GATHERING THE CROP.</h3>

<p class='c058'>The mushrooms will now show in various sizes, from pin-head to
large, full-grown specimens, singly and in dense clusters. As fast as
they reach the desired size twist them from their sockets. Do not cut
or pull them. Keep the gills downward, to prevent dirt getting in them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_728'>728</span>Take care not to disturb those left in the beds more than is necessary.
It is unnecessary to add, cook them, but it is very necessary to tell how,
because many excellent cooks commit the outrageous sacrilege of peeling
mushrooms. A large amount of the flavor and deliciousness of a
mushroom is in the skin—as it is in the apple. One might just as well
peel a strawberry. First, always holding the plant gills downward and
not over others, cut away the extreme base of the stem and brush off
any adhering dirt. If the cap shows much scruff, rub it off with a piece
of coarse flannel or cloth. Throw the mushrooms thus cleaned into cold
water; they will float. Run the fingers through them several times,
then lift them to a fresh pan of water, wash them and place them,
gills downward, on a cloth to drain, or put them in a colander. Then
cook them to taste. Here, again, sacrilege is frequent. Many foods
are simply mediums for added flavors.  Not so the mushroom; it
has a decided, exquisite flavor of its own.  It should not be made
in cooking to taste like something else.  Put the mushrooms in a
stew-pan with a little water; cover them, and stew slowly for twenty
minutes, adding butter, salt and pepper to taste. Cream or milk may
be added. Another very good way is to butter well a medium-hot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_729'>729</span>pan; cut the mushrooms into equal-sized pieces, put them in it, cover,
and fry. Stir them from time to time, and when quite done season with
salt and pepper. A good gravy is made for them by using water, milk
or cream. Now if you must have a meat of some sort, put the meat on
one dish and the mushrooms on another. By doing this you spoil the
taste of neither.</p>

<p class='c051'>Beds will continue to produce for several weeks if properly cared for.
As soon as they cease bearing remove them, clean up, white-wash, coal-oil
every inch of wood, salt the floor, and be ready to try again. After
the amateur has his or her hand in, the bed area can be largely increased
by building rough berths, one above the other, in which beds can be
made. An important bit of advice is: Start in a small way. Do not
expend any more money than you can afford to lose.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
